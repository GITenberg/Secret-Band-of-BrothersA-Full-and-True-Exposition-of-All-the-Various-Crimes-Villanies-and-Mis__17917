<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The vice of gambling is peculiarly destructive. It
spares neither age nor sex. It visits the domestic
hearth with a pestilence more quiet and stealthy, but
not less deadly, than intemperance. It is at once the
vice of the gentleman, and the passion of the blackguard.
With deep shame we are forced to admit that
the halls of legislation have not been free from its influence,
nor the judicial bench unstained by its pollution.</p>

<p>It is against this vice, which is now spreading like
a subtle poison through all grades of society, that the
present work is directed. The author is not a mere
theorist. He speaks from experience&mdash;dark and bitter
experience. The things he has seen he tells; the
words he has heard he speaks again. Some of these
scenes curdle the blood in the veins, even when remembered;
some of these words, whenever whispered,
recall incidents of singular atrocity, and thrill the
bosom with horror.</p>

<p>The author professes to speak nothing but the plain
truth. He does not aspire to an elegant style of
writing, adorned with the ornaments of the orator and
the scholar; but to one quality may lay claim, without
being thought a vain or immodest man. He
speaks with an earnest sincerity. Whatever he says
comes from his heart, and is spoken with all the sympathy
of his soul.</p>

<p>This work differs from all the previous works of the
author. Indeed, it is unlike any thing ever published
in this country. It is not a mere exposure of gam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>bling,
nor yet an attack on the character of particular
gamblers. It is a revelation of a wide-spread organization&mdash;pledged
to gambling, theft, and villany of all
kinds. There are at the present time existing, in our
Union, certain organizations, pledged to the performance
of good works, which merit the hearty approbation
of every honest man. These are called secret
societies, although their proceedings, and the names
of the officers, with minute particulars, are published
in a thousand shapes. Prominent among these beneficial
orders stand the Odd Fellows and the Sons of
Temperance. But the order, whose history is related
in the following pages, differs from all these. Its proceedings,
the names of its members or its officers, and
even its very existence as a body, have hitherto been
secret, and sealed from the whole world. Besides, it is
pledged to accomplish all kinds of robbery, aye, and
even worse deeds. It has, in more than one deplorable
instance, concealed its dark deeds with murder.</p>

<p>This order is not confined in its operations to the
dark places of life. It numbers among its members
the professional man, the "respectable citizen," the
prominent and wealthy of various towns throughout
the Union; nay, it has sometimes invaded the house
of God, and secured the services of those who are
ostensibly his ministers.</p>

<p>There is not a line of fiction in these pages. The
solemn truth is told, in all its strange and horrible
interest. To the public, to the candid of all classes,
to the friends of reform, to the honest citizen, and to
the sincere Christian, the author makes his appeal.</p>

<p>Let not his voice of warning be unheeded. Let
all be up and doing, so that the monster may be
exterminated from the face of the earth, and the youth
of the present age be saved from destruction.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>In perusing the following pages, the reader will learn
the history of a class of men, who, for talent, cannot be
excelled. He may startle at the horrid features which
naked truth will depict&mdash;at deeds of darkness which,
though presented to an enlightened people, may require
a stretch of credulity to believe were ever perpetrated in
the glorious nineteenth century.</p>

<p>It will, no doubt, elicit many a curious thought, especially
with honest men, and the "whys and wherefores"
will pass from mouth to mouth in every hamlet, village,
and town, where the following recital may find a reader
or hearer. All will declare it mysterious. It is a mystery
to myself in some particulars, but in others it is not.
It is strange, passing strange, to think that such a black-hearted,
treacherous band of men, as I am about to describe,
could have existed so long in a civilized and Christian
country.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand do I attempt to bring to light
their ruling principles, to develop a system of organized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and accomplished villany. My reasons for assuming so
daring a position may seem to require an explanation. It
may be asked why I did not make this revelation before,
as far as I had knowledge, or what is the occasion of the
present exposition? To the preceding queries I will
briefly reply.</p>

<p>First, There has been no period in my life, prior to
1846, when I could dare to lay before the world what I
contemplate doing at the present time. It will be long
remembered by many, that in August, 1842, I renounced
a profession, in which I had worse than squandered twelve
years, the sweet morning of my life. In doing so, I knew
I must, of necessity, experience deep mortification, in a
personal exposure, which would attend me through life.</p>

<p>Gambling, with all its concomitants, had taken full possession
of my depraved nature. Thus it was that I, like
all wicked men, refused to "come to the light," and I
feared to oppose a craft so numerous as the one of which
I was a professed member. Well did I know that I was
carrying out a wrong and wicked principle. Conviction
produced reflection. After a careful deliberation of the
whole subject, I declared with a solemn oath, that, by the
assistance of Almighty God, I would renounce for ever a
profession so ruinous in its every feature. Immediately
I felt the band severed, and my misgivings were scattered
to the winds. My former companions laughed at me.
They scouted the idea, that one so base as I should ever
think of reformation. It moved me not. My credit, I
found, failed, after it was known that I had quit gambling.
A thousand different conjectures attended so strange a
proceeding on the part of one in my circumstances.
Why should I abandon card-playing, destroy valuable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>card plates, and lose their still more profitable proceeds,
return moneyed obligations, which would have secured
me an independent fortune? These things were a matter
of surprise with the cool and deliberate patrons of vice,
and especially with many, who, though they were often
covered with a garb of outward morality, were full of rottenness
within. Some, who pass for moral and religious
persons, have in this thing exhibited a moral obliquity
that has often astonished me.</p>

<p>From a careful examination, I have learned the lamentable
fact, that the most prominent opposers of moral reforms
are composed of two classes, <span class="smcap">the hardened sinner</span>, who
makes money his god, and <span class="smcap">the extremely ignorant</span>.
Let not the reader understand, however, that I suppose
there are not ignorant rich men as well as poor&mdash;the latter
have their share of bad men, and so also have the
former&mdash;but that vice and ignorance are common to both.</p>

<p>In the year 1843, I commenced lecturing against the fearful
vice of gambling, for no other reason than to stay the
gambler in his ruinous course, and save the youth of our
land from his alluring wiles. For this I received <span class="smcap">in public</span>
the "God speeds" of <span class="smcap">all</span> classes, and the prayers of
all Christians in secret. I soon learned I had much with
which to contend&mdash;opposition from directions I little anticipated.
The gambler, unfortunate man! he carried
upon his countenance an expression of open hate, indicating
a deadly hostility to my reformatory movements. The
ignorant man, I found, was disposed to make his avarice
the highway to happiness. He was unwilling to favour
any reform that would invade the territory of his contracted
selfishness. His reply, if he had any, would be
that stereotyped one, "such a course will have a tendency
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>to make more gamblers than it will cure." If his reasons
were asked for such a statement, you could get no satisfactory
answer. Perhaps he would say, "I am satisfied
of the fact from my own disposition." He might as well
give a child's reason at once, and say, "<span class="smcap">cause</span>!" Such
persons have seldom heard a lecture, or read a syllable,
and yet are always prating with a great show of wisdom,
but rather, in fact, of blind conceit. Their silence would
be of far more service to the cause of virtue than their
opinions. In many cases, it will be found that such persons
are not only ignorant, but dishonest.</p>

<p>Again, there is the rich, moral, or religious man, who
takes another position. He opposes with the declaration
"his sons will not gamble: they have such good and
moral examples," &amp;c. This is sometimes a want of consideration,
that prompts them thus to speak; with others,
a secret villany, driving them to such ultra positions, a
mere tattered garment to cover their own moral deformity.
They must oppose the reformation, or be held up to public
disgrace. In nine cases out of ten, the opposer of this
class, is, or has been, a participant in the works of darkness
whose exposition he so much dreads.</p>

<p>Finding many disposed to act thus, and to teach their
children to imitate their own pernicious examples, I have
made it a study to demolish, if possible, the foundation of
their positions. The success attending my efforts to trace
them out, assures me, that I am correct when I affirm
that two-thirds of all opposers are influenced in their conduct
by the basest of principles; one-sixth act through
ignorance, united with vice, and one-sixth are wholly
ignorant and cannot be morally accountable, if their want
of information is in any way excusable. But what may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>be still more startling, about one-fourth of the whole are
members of the various churches, yea, even men of this
class are found in sacerdotal robes. This fact came
within my knowledge long since. I felt it my duty to
publish the same, but delayed, till I should gain experience
in defending my position. I was satisfied, however,
that the efforts of a certain New Light minister to
traduce my character and hinder my influence, must have
been prompted from some of the foregoing considerations.
Would the world know who this man is? It will be necessary
to go to the very town where he lives to secure
the information. I doubt whether his name would ever
have appeared in print, but for his newspaper controversy,
or in case of his death. His unwarrantable attack
put me on my guard, and caused me to search out the
ground of his base and unchristian treatment. One thing
is very certain, he is no gambler. It may not be a want
of disposition, but rather a sufficient amount of sense, to
make him a proficient in the business. He may be an
ignorant dupe&mdash;a mere tool of the designing, the "cats
paw" of some respectable blackleg, who thinks to cover
his own crimes, by exciting public opinion against me,
through an apparently respectable instrumentality. But
I did not wish to bandy words with him, being impressed
with the propriety of a resolution I made while a gambler,
that it is only throwing away time to attempt to account
for the different actions and opinions of weak and
prejudiced minds; and therefore I dropped the whole
affair. I would have remained silent, but for the position
taken by other divines from his false and garbled statements.
Many have condemned me unheard, listening
willingly to my accusers, without hearing a word in my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>own defence. Not satisfied with such an expression of
their <span class="smcap">excessive christian charity</span>, they have even thrust
at me through the public prints, for which, no doubt,
they will have the hearty amens of all gamblers, and it
may be several dollars in their pockets. Certain editors
have joined in the same "hue and cry" with their
worthy compeers. The reasons were evident in their
case. They knew I was invading their dearest worldly
interests. There were others who only knew me from
hearsay. Why should they become my enemies? It
was because I held in my possession secrets, whose exposition
would make many of them tremble. It would
be to them like the interpreted handwriting upon the
wall. Hence they were ready to contribute their talents
and wealth, to sustain certain individuals as honourable
men. I could not have deemed it proper to expose "<span class="smcap">the
Secret Band of Brothers</span>," had not duty, and my obligations
to society, urged me forward. The allegiance
I owe to God is paramount to all other. The result is yet
to be experienced, by the better part of the community.
Heavily was the oppressive hand of this notable brotherhood
laid upon me. My soul was sorely vexed by their
daring villany.</p>

<p>In the county where I was bred, I have numbered, in
one day, thirteen who sustained honourable places in
society, nine of whom were rich, strangely rich in view
of their facilities for acquiring wealth in a newly settled
country. Not one is a professional man. Few bear the
callous badge of industry and physical exertion upon
their hands. Several are, by an outward profession,
Christians,&mdash;but invariably opposed to all the benevolent
institutions of the day and works of reform, unless their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>views of what is the right course are fully met, which
are generally so extravagant as to preclude all hope of
co-operation. With these I had a severe contest. Well
did they know, there was something behind the screen
which, brought to light, would expose their villanous
transactions, open the eyes of honest men, and greatly
endanger, if not destroy, their craft. That I had letters,
written by themselves, they knew&mdash;nor dare they deny
it&mdash;letters which might lead to a conviction of crime, that
would raise them to a position somewhere between heaven
and earth. They may rest assured that I have documents
that place more than one thousand of them in a
relative position to law and society.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>In a previous work of mine, called "<span class="smcap">Gambling Unmasked</span>,"
an allusion is made to an evident conspiracy
against my life, sometime before I became a confirmed
gambler. Goodrich was the name which I gave, as the
chief actor. This same doubly refined villain, it will be
remembered, by all who have read the above work, was
foremost to aid in my arrest when I made good my escape
to the Pine woods, lying back of New Orleans. The
reader will likewise recollect, that I could not, at that
time, account for such manifestations of unprecedented
malignity, on the part of one from whom I might rather
expect protection than persecution. But the secret is
out, and I now have the power to give clear and truthful
explanations.</p>

<p>This Goodrich, who resides at the present time in or
near New Orleans, and who holds the rank of gambler-general
in that city of Sodom, was an old and advanced
member of the "Secret Band of Brothers." Knowing,
as he did, that I was engaged in assisting the honest part
of the community to convict two brothers who were plotting
my downfall, as a sworn member of the above fraternity,
he was solemnly bound to do all in his power to
aid in the consummation of my personal ruin. That the
world might know something of this Goodrich, (though
the half cannot be told,) I gave, in my autobiography,
several incidents, in which he acted a prominent part.
What I then said will answer for an introduction.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>That he was connected with an organized association
of gentlemen blacklegs will not be denied. The proof is
abundant. Nor was he an apprentice, a mere novitiate;
but long schooled in vice and ripening year by year, he
swelled quite beyond the bounds of ordinary meanness,
till he became a full-grown monster of his kind. Not
content to gather riches by common roguery, he sought
out the basest instrumentalities as more congenial to his
real disposition. His chief riches were obtained by dark
and murderous transactions; and had he a score of necks,
with hempen necklaces well adjusted, I doubt whether
he could pay the full forfeiture to the law.</p>

<p>From my first acquaintance with him at Louisville,
with blood-thirsty vigilance he sought my destruction.
Here began the risings of his malice, and this was the
cause. In the year 1830, I gave information to the city
police in relation to Hyman, who, at that time, was the
keeper of a hotel. It was while at this house, that Goodrich
became my determined and implacable foe. I had
been duped by two brothers, Daniel and James Brown,
who were then confined in the calaboose for passing
counterfeit money. Large quantities were also found in
their possession. I was their confidant, so far as prudence
would allow them to make any revelations. That
they were guilty of the crime with which they had been
charged, no honest man could doubt, after being made
acquainted with the circumstances. Yet they would
swear most stoutly, even in my presence, that they were
innocent, and that they had been deceived. I could not
but believe they were guilty, after having witnessed so
many of their iniquitous actions. Often have I been told
by the wife of one of them, that they could call to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>assistance, if necessary, a thousand men. Who they
were and where they were, so ready to uphold these
abandoned men, I had, at that time, no knowledge.</p>

<p>At length their situation became desperate. Already
had they passed one year within the walls of a gloomy
prison, without the privilege of a trial. They were required
to give bail in the sum of twenty thousand dollars
each. No satisfactory bonds could be procured. The
whole community were incensed against them. They
had for a long time trampled upon private rights and
warred against the best interests of the people. They
had set at defiance all laws instituted for purposes of justice
and protection, and they could not but expect a stern
rebuke from all the friends of morality and good order.
The only prospect before them, upon a fair trial, was a
sentence of twenty years to the penitentiary. This was
by no means cheering, especially to those who had lived
in ease and affluence, whose bodies were enervated by
voluptuousness and hands made tender by years of idle
pleasures. Crowds were gathering to witness their trial,
and waiting in anxious suspense the issue. Disgrace,
public disgrace and lasting infamy stared them in the
face. They were put upon their last resources, and necessity
became the mother of invention. They fixed
upon the following plan to extricate themselves.</p>

<p>Public opinion must be propitiated. An interest in
their behalf must be awakened by some manifestation
that would touch the chord of sympathy. A double part
must be played. They would affect to change their sentiments.
In this they acted according to the laws of the
secret brotherhood. With them, any thing was honesty
that would effect their purposes. But to consummate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>their design, another object must be secured&mdash;some innocent
person must be implicated and made a scape-goat
for, at least, a part of their crimes. This game they understood
well, for they had been furnished with abundant
means and instructions. It required also deep-seated
iniquity of heart, and in this there was no lack, for they
were the sublimation of depravity. They must also have
time and capital. These were easily provided, as will
be seen in the sequel. There was an individual with
whom they had become acquainted in Cleaveland, and
upon whom suspicion had rested for some time. He
was the man fixed upon as their victim. Of course he
was not a member of their organized band. "Honour
among thieves" forbids the selection of such a one. It
was necessary, however, that he should be somewhat of
a villain. Here also they exhibited much sagacity in the
selection. It now only remained to slip his neck into the
noose that was in preparation for themselves. All the
instrumentalities being prepared to their liking, they immediately
set the infernal machinery in active operation.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to change the direction
of public opinion as to the real perpetrator. It must be
called off from the persons who were now so hotly pursued,
and put upon a different scent. The agents were
at hand&mdash;The Secret Band of Brothers. These "dogs
of war" were let loose, and simultaneously the whole
pack set up their hideous yell after the poor fellow previously
mentioned. Many of them being merchants and
holding a respectable relation to society, and most of them
being connected with the different honourable professions,
their fell purpose was the more easily accomplished. A
continual excitement was thus kept up, by breathing forth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>calumny and denunciation against one who, however
guilty of other things, was innocent of the thing laid to
his charge. At the same time, the ears of the principal
bank-officers were filled with words of extenuation and
sympathy toward the two brothers. Their former high
respectability was adduced. That they were guilty was
not denied, but they had been misled and seduced. Intimations
were given that the name of the real villain who
had caused their ruin would be given, provided they
would ease off in their prosecution already in progress.
And then it would be such a glorious thing to secure the
prime-mover.</p>

<p>By these fair and seemingly sincere pretensions, they
soon kindled relentings in the hearts of the prosecutors.
How could it be otherwise? for "they were all honourable
men." Several of the individuals who assisted in
maturing the plan were men of commanding influence,
in the very town where I was bred. I had abundant
opportunities to know them. A proposition was finally
made through them by the instructions of the officers,
that, as the brothers knew their guilt was fully established,
it would have a tendency to mitigate their sentence, if
they would expose the head man, by whose knavery
many extensive property-holders were threatened with total
bankruptcy. This was the precise position at which the
secret band of brothers had been aiming. The next step
was to secure, if possible, the younger brother as "state's
evidence" against the appointed victim of Cleaveland notoriety,
whom, for the sake of convenience, I will designate
by his name, Taylor.</p>

<p>He was a man of extraordinary abilities and gentlemanly
deportment. He and the two brothers were mu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>tual
acquaintances. They had been accomplices, no
doubt, in many a deed of darkness. But as "the devil
should have his due," I am bound to exculpate him
from any participation in the alleged crime. That he
was innocent in this affair I have the fullest evidence. I
was solicited by the pettifogger, (I will not say lawyer,)
for the brothers, to take a bribe for perjury, and swear
poor Taylor guilty of giving me five hundred dollars of
counterfeit money, which money he would place in my
hands. Of this fellow, I will speak in another chapter.
The younger brother was now to declare himself and brother
as having been seduced by Taylor. It was to be
done without the apparent knowledge of the elder brother,
whom we will hereafter call Colonel Brown. It
was to be communicated to one of the officers, with a solicitation
to keep it a secret from the colonel. He also
had an appointed part to play. The character he was
to sustain in this drama of well-concocted treachery, I
will next present.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>The colonel's physician advised him to take medicine,
to reduce his system, and give him the appearance of
one rapidly sinking under a pulmonary affection. He
consented, as such a plan was considered the most likely
to succeed. It will be readily seen, that the design was
to work upon the sympathies of the officers, and thus
procure his enlargement. Nor were they disappointed.
The colonel's health began to fail. The drugs acted
their appropriate part. Some of his friends made vigorous
exertions to have him removed to the hospital, declaring
it necessary for the continuation of life. Others were
actively engaged in giving forth intimations, and expressing
their fears that he would die before his trial came on,
always taking care to assert their confidence of his innocence.
This was a mere ruse, to trick the officers into a
consent for his removal. But they had mistaken the
character of the men with whom they were dealing.
They were not to be moved by exhibitions of suffering
humanity. Their hearts had become insensible to human
misery and they resisted all appeals to sympathy.</p>

<p>There was now but one alternative for the friends of
the prisoner. They must apply the drugs more assiduously,
till they made a mere skeleton of their subject;
and then try the virtue of the "almighty dollar." This
now seemed to be the only thing that would move the
hearts of seven-eighths of the police judges, marshals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>wardens, and prosecutors. Such were the administrators
of public justice, at that time, in New Orleans. The
greater part were men, who, at some period of their
lives, had been steeped chin-deep in infamy. Some were
men of wealth and liberally educated. They were men
who would shrink from giving an account of their early
years. Several were verging upon three score years and
ten. All the wealth they possessed had been plundered
from another set of villains, whose misfortune was, a want
of sagacity in escaping the rapacity of their more accomplished
compeers. That there were a few honourable
exceptions must be admitted, but I could not with a good
conscience assert, that one-eighth of the police was as
honest as is generally the case with those city officers, for
I have facts to the contrary.</p>

<p>The whole of that Southern Sodom at an early date
had been inundated with this "secret band of brothers,"
or this fraternal band of land pirates. As they became
wealthy they ceased their usual occupation, and began to
speculate in a different way. Having it in their power,
they would rob even their nearest friends, thus overleaping
that common law of "honour among thieves." They
would do this with the utmost impunity, whenever they
saw proper. There was no redress. The very officers
were, many of them, under fictitious names and would
assume deceptive titles, for the more successful perpetration
of their villany.</p>

<p>The unfortunate prisoner discovered, when it was too
late, that his supposed HONEST BROTHERHOOD were not
what their profession had led him to believe. Poor fellow!
he had not taken enough degrees to learn the full
"mystery of iniquity." Every effort was made to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>cure
a light bail, but it could not be effected. At last an
arrangement was made, and for a stipulated sum he was
placed in charge of a committee, who had him removed
to the hospital. The colonel, by this time, was, to appearance,
very dangerously ill. He was removed to his new
quarters, but not permitted to regain his health, lest the
spell of their deceit should be broken. His visitors were
numerous. To his face, they appeared his most sincere
friends. They seemed deeply interested in his welfare,
and made bountiful proffers of sympathy and assistance.
His true friends, who were capable of rendering him succour,
were very few. He had many of the lower class
of the brotherhood, the novitiates, who were ready to act
energetically and in good faith. But the head men&mdash;the
very individuals who had reaped the spoils of his doings&mdash;were
his worst enemies. They had received the lion's
share, without leaving the poor jackall even the scraps,
but turned him over, unaided, to the tender mercies of a
felon's fate. They had filled their pockets with the
richest of the spoils, and would not now contribute a
penny to reward their benefactor.</p>

<p>At this time, there were one hundred of the brotherhood
in the city, who might have procured bail; but
gratitude found no place in their hearts. They had also
violated their oaths. Day after day would parties of his
old friends and neighbours visit him, both in the prison
and hospital. They would tell him that arrangements
were in progress to effect his escape. The whole, however,
was false, as no action had been taken. The prisoner
depended much upon a delegation from Dearborn
county, Indiana, of whom he had a right to claim assistance;
but they, like the rest, proved traitors. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>counted thirty different men from that county, who visited
him from time to time. These, at home, were men of
good standing, equally respected with other citizens.
Several were leading men in all the moral and religious
enterprises of the day, and generally individuals of
wealth. Two of them, I knew, made great professions
of religious enjoyment and zeal. One was a very strict
church-going man, but with the heart of a Judas. His
hypocrisy was of such a deep and damning character, I
can hardly forbear giving his name. Duty might demand
his exposure, but for the injury that would be inflicted
upon an innocent family. These men may reform. I
am delaying exposure. I hope ere long to have an evidence
of their sincere repentance, but fear they are too
far gone, too much in love with the wages of iniquity.
They have too long turned a deaf ear to the pitiful cries
of the widow and orphan whose ruin they have effected,
whose natural protector they may have robbed, leaving
his injured family in penury and want. Some of these,
who were comparatively poor at the time of the colonel's
downfall, in 1832, have since become rich. There is
reason to fear that such sudden wealth, obtained without
any visible means, was not very honourably acquired. It
is seldom that honest industry will thus accumulate. The
letters I shall publish will be accompanied with explanatory
notes. The persons concerned will recognise their
own productions, and I hope to see such a change in their
future life as shall deserve a charitable silence. But I
return from my digression.</p>

<p>The sworn friends of the prisoner had forsaken him in
the hour of need, and left him single-handed and alone to
meet the stern rigours of the law. There was no remedy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>unless in his own stratagem, which was now being matured.
It was as follows. His brother was to remain in
prison as an evidence against Taylor, mentioned in the
previous chapter, while he was to assume all the responsibility
of the counterfeit money, plates, &amp;c., as well as
all the other villanies which had been charged upon them
conjointly.</p>

<p>The colonel was very sick from the action of the medicines.
He supposed every effort had been made to bail
him, but was greatly deceived. His fate was sealed. A
conspiracy was formed against him. He suspected foul
play, because his former associates did not come forward
and bail him. His removal to the hospital was only a
pretence set up by them, that might give more time to
carry out their treacherous designs. He was a prisoner,
and they were determined to make him such the remainder
of his life. He had his friends, however, warmhearted,
and true. He was almost worshipped by the
poorer members of the brotherhood. The richer part
envied him for his superior skill in his profession and
general popularity, and feared the consequences. In this
he differed widely from his brother, who was neither
loved nor feared, and was only respected from his relationship.
When the plan was devised for the younger brother
to swear the counterfeit money and plates upon
Taylor, it was intended by these professed friends, that
he should be caught in his own net, and be thus prevented
from rendering the colonel any assistance. The
consummation of this plan, I will next detail.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>The younger brother was to produce various letters
which had been written to him from different parts of the
Union, by different individuals. That this could be done
will be seen by what follows. The colonel had been an
extensive speculator in merchandise of almost every kind.
He was extensively known. His correspondence was
wide-spread. In his villanous communications, however,
letters were never addressed to him in his proper
name, unless some one should labour under the impression
that he was an honest man. He used two fictitious
names; the one was George Sanford, and the other that
of his brother. These letters were placed in the hands
of that brother for safe keeping. Thus the colonel, to all
appearance, only maintained an honourable and necessary
business correspondence. He consented that his brother
should use these letters if they could be made useful in
helping him out of difficulty. He was willing the letters
should be produced and read, as the younger brother had
promised to bring forth the plates. In the mean time
there was an understanding between them, that no intimations
should be given as to the "secret band of brothers;"
not a syllable was to be lisped that would lead to
exposure.</p>

<p>To obtain the desired end, and give greater security,
instructions were given to the wife of one of the brothers
to examine carefully all the letters, and select out from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>them those of a specific character, and to keep them
sacred, subject to the order of the colonel. These letters
had been conveyed in a chest from Canada, where they
had been preserved with great secrecy. This chest was
sent for in February, 1832, and arrived the next April.
Some three days after the reception of the trunk containing
these papers, information was given that the removed
letters had come, and were ready for the examination of
those who were acting as prosecutors of Taylor. By this
time, public opinion had become so much changed toward
both of the prisoners, that a very little effort would have secured
their acquittal. They had acted with great skill and
prudence, and were in a fair way to succeed. This was perceived
by the leaders of the fraternity. They were unwilling
such a man as the colonel should escape. A deep plot
was consequently laid and rigorously carried out to thwart
him in his efforts to escape the penalty of the law. His trial
was put off and the inducement held out that bail should
be obtained. All this was done to keep up appearances.
His enemies dared not openly provoke him. They dared
not come out and proclaim their hostility, for they well
knew he had the means to expose them. To seek his
ruin by an open show of opposition would be to touch fire
to the train, that, in the explosion, would involve them all
in a common ruin. They must approach him, Joab like,
and drive the dagger to his heart while saluting him with
professions of friendship. But his patience had become
wearied by a protracted sickness and continued disappointment.</p>

<p>The letters above referred to were done up in packages
of three hundred each. I was present when the trunk
was opened, and witnessed the selection of many of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>letters. The lady who assorted them threw about one
out of every thirty in a separate pile. I made no inquiry
respecting them, but my curiosity, as you may well imagine,
was not a little excited, especially as I observed
several familiar names. The lady finally unrolled six
pieces of parchment, which were blank in appearance.
She folded them up in a square form of about six inches.
She then folded up some three hundred and seventy letters,
and placed them upon the parchment. Upon these
she placed a written parchment containing the copies of
about six hundred letters, and having carefully enclosed
the whole in a sealed envelope, she placed them between
two beds upon which she usually slept. The remainder
she packed up and sent to her husband's attorney. Immediately
she left the room to visit her husband in prison.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she retired, before my curiosity was intensely
excited to learn the contents of the concealed package.
I ventured into the room with the intention of
satisfying myself. I no sooner placed my hand upon the
package, than I felt the blood seemingly curdling in my
veins. The thought that I was about to act the part of a
dishonest man impressed me deeply. I reflected a moment,
and then dropped the package, and hastened to
leave the room. As I turned from the bedside, my desire
to know the contents of the package came upon me
with a redoubled force. The passion was too violent for
resistance, for I was confident some of these letters were
written by men I had known from my infancy. Whether
I acted properly or improperly, an impartial public must
determine; but after thinking upon the subject a moment,
I turned, grasped the package, and bore it off under the
keenest sensations of alarm and fear of detection. I has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>tened
down stairs and made my way to the house of a
man by the name of Watkins. He was a good man, and
a sincere friend to me. His wife was a kind-hearted and
benevolent woman. I met her at the door, and told her
a friend of mine had given me this package to take care
of, and I would let her see the contents at another time.
She took it and laid it away; I then hastened to the prison
to meet Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, who I knew expected me to
accompany her, or to be present with her that day. Could
I get to the prison as soon, or sooner than she, suspicion
of my having taken the package would be lessened. I
soon found myself at the prison gate. The lady had not
yet arrived. The prisoners were standing around the
door on the inside. I waited some ten minutes, when I
heard B. say he did not see what could detain his wife
so long. I stepped to the door and remarked that I had
been waiting some time, and was expecting her every
minute. Immediately she made her appearance and
remarked,</p>

<p>"You have got here before me. I looked for you before
I left."</p>

<p>I had observed her looking into the room I occupied,
when she was about leaving the house; I, however, was
in an opposite one, occupied by another boarder. After
conversing a short time with her husband, she remarked,
that she must return to the house, as she had left the
package where it might be found. She called upon me to
accompany her. I did so, and we soon arrived at the
house. I remained below while she hastened up stairs
to her room.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she came running to the head of the
stairs and called me; I immediately answered her.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Green," said she, "some person has been robbing
my room."</p>

<p>I felt as though I was suspected, for "a guilty conscience
needs no accusing."</p>

<p>"What have you had taken?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have"&mdash;&mdash;then she paused, as if studying
what to say. In the mean time, the landlady had heard
her say she had been robbed, and hastened to the place
where we were standing, but being unobserved from the
excitement, was occupying a position at Mrs. B.'s back.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have lost a package of letters, of no value to
any person but myself. They are family relics, but I
will have them at the peril of my life. I will swear that
I have lost other things besides the papers, and will get
them back, or make this house pay well for harbouring
thieves. Mind, Green, what I have said. Keep mum,
and I will have them back at the risk of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the landlady, who very kindly
assisted her in finishing her sentence by adding&mdash;"at
the risk of perjuring yourself!"</p>

<p>Mrs. B. being startled, exclaimed, "Oh! no, madam,
don't mistake me. I only meant I would make a great
stir about them&mdash;that I would offer a reward to the servants,
and at the same time let on as if something very
valuable was missing."</p>

<p>"Of course I would not intimate, and do not, I pray
you, understand me as thinking that any person has taken
them with the design of retaining them. I have no idea
that the individual having them, whoever he may be,
will be base enough to keep them from me. Some of
them are very ancient, and among the number are several
sheets of blank parchment, which belonged to my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>grandfather. I have preserved them as a memento.
Their loss would be a source of great grief."</p>

<p>The landlady turned away, apparently satisfied with
her statement and forced apology. She then turned to
me and said,</p>

<p>"I will have those papers at the price of my life. If
they are lost"&mdash;here she made a stop and added, "I shall
dislike it."</p>

<p>I discovered an extreme anxiety depicted in her features&mdash;her
breast was actually heaving with emotion.</p>

<p>"Green," said she, "has old Cunningham been about
here to-day?"</p>

<p>"I believe not," was my reply. "I have not seen
him."</p>

<p>"Well," she continued, "I hope he may never enter
this house again, though he appears to be the best friend
that my husband and the colonel possess. He pays strict
attention to his business, at the same time, which does
not seem consistent."</p>

<p>This Cunningham, so abruptly introduced, was a man
quite advanced in years, a member of the fraternity, and,
considering his age, was a very active and efficient agent.
At this juncture, the old servant, who attended to the
room, entered. She (Mrs. B.) inquired "if any person
had been in her room during her absence to the prison."
The servant tried to recollect. While he delayed, my
heart palpitated violently from fear, lest he might say he
had seen me enter her room. I was on the point of confessing
the whole matter. I felt that I was suspected.
At this critical moment he broke the silence&mdash;a silence
burdened with anxiety to the lady as well as myself, by
remarking that he had seen the old gentleman (mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ing
Cunningham) "go up stairs, and he thought enter
her room."</p>

<p>"I have it!" exclaimed she. "He has got them."
I need not tell the reader I felt greatly relieved, that
there was at least the shadow of evidence, which would
serve to clear me and implicate Cunningham. The lady
appeared to be intensely excited. I was in doubt what
course it would be prudent for me to pursue. Finally, I
went to the house of Watkins, and told him that the package
I had given him was of no value to any person but
myself; that it was made up of various articles of writing,
containing hundreds of names, many of which were familiar
to me. He looked them over in a cursory manner,
and remarked,</p>

<p>"I think there must be witchcraft in these. The letters,
though very simple, bear upon their face a suspicious
appearance." He, however, agreed to preserve
them with care.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>After my interview with Watkins, I felt greatly relieved.
I hastened to the hospital to see the colonel, as
was my custom, often several times a day. I found him
surrounded with visitors, all of whom appeared to be affected
while in his presence. He needed sympathy.
His mind was tortured. His whole life seemed made up
of successive throes of excitement and desperation. His
heart was torn by conflicting passions. His confidence
and affection for former friends were evidently waning.
If any remained, it hung like the tremulous tones of
music uncertain and discordant upon its shivered strings.
After the principal visitors had retired, the following
individuals, three from Lawrenceburgh, two from Cincinnati,
one from Madison, and one from Frankfort, made
their appearance, accompanied by one of the colonel's
legal advisers. They counseled with him for some time.
The legal gentleman remarked, at the close of the mutual
conversation:</p>

<p>"It will do. I have conversed with your friends,"
calling his two principal attorneys by name. "They say
something of that kind must be done. It will have a
powerful effect. T. cannot ward off such licks as we
will give him."</p>

<p>The meaning of this fellow was, that bribery could be
effectually used. This man, who thus offered to subvert,
by the basest of means, the claims of public and private
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>justice, was so lost to shame and self-respect, that he verily
thought it an honourable and creditable act, if he could
render himself notorious for clearing the most abandoned
scoundrels. It argued the most deep-seated depravity,
to commit unblushing crime and then glory in his infamy.
He heeded not the means, so he accomplished his end.
He would not hesitate to implicate himself, for it was but
a few days after this, when he offered me a bribe, as before
stated, and likewise the counterfeit money. (I here
have reference to the five hundred dollars, to which I referred
in my work called "Gambling Unmasked.")</p>

<p>After the party had retired, the colonel said in a few
days he would be able to secure bail&mdash;that they were
waiting for an intimate friend,&mdash;a wholesale merchant
from Philadelphia. He then conversed with me more
freely, and told me much about his enemies in Dearborn
Co., Ind., and also his intimate friends. Said he:</p>

<p>"You may live to hear of my success in making some
of those Dearborn county fellows glad to leave their nests,
which they have feathered at my expense."</p>

<p>It was the next day after this, that I made known to
Mr. Munger the fact, that a bribe had been proffered me
to swear against T., in favour of the brothers. Some two
days after, I received the note containing the information
respecting the hidden treasure. See the work above
mentioned.</p>

<p>These circumstances, with the excitement occasioned
by the loss of the package, created a great sensation,
especially with the friends of the colonel and his brother.
Fear and jealousy were at work with the whole banditti
of public swindlers. They knew not on whom to fix the
imputation of purloining their valuable papers. Cun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>ningham
was suspected, and likewise Spurlock, another
old confederate, who had frequently visited the room of
the unfortunate lady. Sturtivant, one of their principal
engravers, was thought to be implicated, and even one
of their pettifoggers was on the list of the proscribed.
They did not fix upon me till several days after. The
circumstances of this suspicion I will now detail.</p>

<p>The Lawrenceburgh members had not complied with
their promises. One was waiting to turn his produce
into cash, and when he was ready to fulfil his engagement,
no action could be taken, because his fellow townsmen
had their excuses for delay and non-concurrence.
The Philadelphia merchant had arrived, but suddenly
left, as the report says, "between two days." Two
others of the intended bail were among the missing. I
carried a letter to another, who owned a flat-boat. I went
on board and found his son, but learned that the father
had gone up the coast on business, to be absent several
days. The son took the letter, broke it open, and read
it. He told me to say to the colonel that his father was
absent and had written to him that he intended starting
home in a few days, probably by the next boat. I went
back and bore the message. The lawyer who had given
me the letter cursed me for permitting the son to open it.
The colonel turning over on his bed, and fastening his
eyes upon the enraged attorney, with a mingled expression
of anger and despair, said,</p>

<p>"I am gone, there is no hope for me. I see, I see, they
have robbed me of my property, my papers, poisoned,
and then forsaken me. I have not much more confidence
in you than in the rest."</p>

<p>"My dear colonel," said the implicated sycophant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
"do you think I would ever treat so basely a client so
liberal and worthy as yourself," at the same time wiping
his cheek as if a tear had been started by such an unkind
imputation.</p>

<p>He then requested me to go for Mrs. B., and tell her,
he requested her presence at the hospital. I went in
search of the wife, but did not meet with her. I found
some ten or fifteen of the band awaiting her return.
Night came on, and she had not yet made her appearance.
I perceived they were in great perturbation.</p>

<p>This same day my room had been changed to a small
apartment in close proximity with the one occupied by
Mrs. B., separated only by a thin board partition. About
two o'clock at night she came home, accompanied by two
females. One left in a few minutes, as she had company
waiting for her at the door. The other remained and
entered into conversation with Mrs. B. I laid my ear to
the partition and could distinctly hear every word which
was spoken. I heard Mrs. B. say, "I have searched in
a satisfactory manner, and am convinced that some one
has removed the earth. I did not expect to find it, after
my husband told me some one had answered him in my
name and taken the note."</p>

<p>I was now satisfied that she had been in search of the
money I had found at the root of the tree, on the corner
of Canal and Old Levee streets. I could not hear the
opinion they entertained, but the strange female remarked,
that</p>

<p>"Colonel Goodrich suspects him, and will certainly
catch him, provided he has got it."</p>

<p>"I do not think he can have it," said Mrs. B.; "I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>never seen the least evidence of guilt; besides, the colonel,"
meaning her brother-in-law, "says he is perfectly harmless."</p>

<p>I was then convinced that it was myself they were
talking about. My fears were awakened, so much so
that I passed a very restless night.</p>

<p>Early the next morning I hurried away to Mr. Munger's
room and laid open my fears. It may be proper to
state in this connection, that this Mr. Munger, whom I
made my confidant, was the United States deputy-marshal.</p>

<p>The search above referred to was for money which had
been hid by Sandford, and he, at his death, had informed
Mr. B. where he had deposited it. The particulars, together
with the manner by which I came in possession
of it, are detailed in "<span class="smcap">Gambling Unmasked</span>."</p>

<p>I found Mr. Munger in his room, and related the incidents
of the past night. He said he could not understand
their meaning. I could, but I did not tell him that the
letters had been taken. For the want of this information,
things looked mysterious. He told me not to fear,
but to flatter those who had requested me to perjure myself,
with a prospect of compliance with their wishes. I
went from his room to my boarding-house, and from
thence to the hospital. Here I found the colonel surrounded
with some twenty citizens, who resided in and
about Wheeling and Pittsburgh, all members of the fraternity.
Some were men of great respectability in the
community where they lived, and doubtless remain so to
the present day. They held out flattering hopes that
bail would yet be secured, but all left the city in a few
days, without rendering any assistance whatever.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The preliminaries for the trial were arranged. Taylor
was indicted. The younger brother being state's evidence,
had an encouraging prospect of acquittal. Unfortunately,
the colonel had taken a wrong position at the start. He
had been betrayed by those of the brotherhood who had
the influence requisite for assistance. The cheat had
been carried so far by fair and continued promises, it was
now too late to retrieve himself. I felt deeply interested
for him. He was a noble specimen of mankind. He
possessed abilities worthy of a more honourable application.
He bore all his misfortunes with unexampled fortitude.
The night after his Wheeling and Pittsburgh
associates had betrayed his confidence, he conversed with
me for some time. The main topic of his conversation
was about certain men who resided in Lawrenceburgh
and its vicinity. He gave recitals of things which had
been done by men living in and near that place, which
cannot be contemplated without a feeling of horror. I
was actually shocked and chilled, especially as I knew
the actors. The whole seemed to me like some dreadful
vision of the night, and I could hardly believe the evidence
of my senses in favor of actual perpetration. The
colonel continued:</p>

<p>"They fear me; they are seeking to crush me while
professing the greatest friendship." He paused after
adding, "to-morrow I will give you some advice which
will be of everlasting benefit. Be careful that you do not
mention it."</p>

<p>Having returned to my boarding-house, I was very
closely interrogated by Mrs. B. and the aforesaid pettifogger,
in reference to my absence.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where had I been all night, and what had detained
me from my meals the day before?"</p>

<p>I told them, at which they eyed one another closely.
Mrs. B. observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think the colonel must be hard run for assistance,
to keep two or three constantly waiting on him."</p>

<p>To this I made no reply, but ate my breakfast fast, and
returned to the hospital. I found Colonel Brown very
restless. During the day several men, from different
cities and towns at a distance, called. Three remained
about two hours with him. They were from Charleston,
on the Kanawha river, Va. After they retired, he lay
in a doze for about an hour, when he was awakened by
the arrival of four visitors, accompanied by his physician.
One made a stand at the door of the colonel, three
came in, while the doctor, with the fourth, passed along
the gallery, to see some other of the inmates. I soon,
learned that two of the three present were from Nashville,
Tenn.; one a merchant, the other a negro trader.
When they began conversation, I stepped to the door.
They talked very rapidly. One said his friend from
Paris, Tenn., would be down in a few days with several
others, from Clarksville. The colonel listened to them
with patience, and replied:</p>

<p>"They had better come, and not disappoint me."</p>

<p>These three left. In a few minutes the physician, in
company with the fourth, came to the door. The doctor
made a short stay, leaving the other man in the room
with the colonel.</p>

<p>It was a matter of surprise to witness the liberty that
was extended to visitors, as well as the prisoner. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>had a guard, it is true, but the steward of the sick rooms
had been ordered not to permit any one to enter the
apartment without a pass, signed by the Board of Trustees;
yet all who wished to visit were allowed a free ingress,
and no questions were asked. I had been taken
there at first by Mrs. B., after which I had free access.
But to return.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The man left there by the doctor, I knew. After
viewing him closely, consider my surprise, when I recognised
a person I had known from my first remembrance.
It was the man who was said by his son to have gone up
the river, and, as I supposed, had returned home. It was
the usual custom of this man, not to go with his flat
boats, but being ladened and committed to skilful pilots,
he took passage upon a steamboat and waited their arrival
at the place of destination. He seemed very much
disconcerted in my presence, but I said nothing to
strengthen his suspicions that I knew him. He cast
several glances at me, at every convenient opportunity.
When he left, it was near night. I was requested by
the colonel to go to my supper and then return. I went
away, and being weary I laid down upon my bed, from
which I did not awake till daylight. On examining my
clothes, I found some person had rifled my pockets. My
wallet was robbed of one paper, which contained a list of
names, but nothing else. Fortunately, however, I had
written the same on my hat lining. I expected to have
heard something concerning the affair&mdash;especially the
record of names, but in this I was happily disappointed.</p>

<p>Having eaten my breakfast, I went to the Custom
house. The United States court was then in session.
Hundreds of the colonel's acquaintances were there every
day. They were frequently giving their opinions as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>the issue of the trial. Some entertained one opinion and
some another,&mdash;their chief conversation was in reference
to the two brothers, and their connection with Taylor.
One of the group I discovered was from Lawrenceburgh,
Indiana. I knew them all, and with the exception of this
one, they extended to me the hand of friendship. They
seemed glad to see me, and were in fact honest men.
He, however, did not seem friendly, though he did speak,
but at the same time gave me a look of disapprobation,
as much as to say, you have no right to be in company
with such honest men. I paid no attention to his looks,
as I knew him better than any man in the crowd. He
knew he had laid himself liable to detection, and hence
did not wish me to be in communication with his old
friends, lest I might become an informant. He rather
desired to have them discard me, but as they were upright,
unsuspecting men, they did not give heed to his
conduct. They conversed freely, and tried in every way
to amuse me. At length he discovered there was a growing
sympathy in my favour, and assumed another attitude
to secure my departure. He began to talk somewhat in
the following strain.</p>

<p>"I know Green is a smart boy, but they say the
Browns have him here to run on errands, and he is
strongly suspected of not being what he should be, in
regard to honesty."</p>

<p>One or two of the honest countrymen spoke in my behalf,
and the whole was turned off in a jovial way, not
wishing, as I suppose, to injure my feelings; at which
he, with a sigh that bespoke the consummate hypocrite,
added:</p>

<p>"Well, Green, God bless you. You had a sainted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>mother, and I always respected your old father, but you
boys, I fear, are all in the downward road to ruin. You
had better return home and be a good boy. Beware of
the company of the Browns, as you know they are bad
characters, and that I, and many others, held them at a
distance, when they were in Lawrenceburgh."</p>

<p>The rest of the company retired while he was thus
lecturing me so sanctimoniously.</p>

<p>No one can imagine the feelings I then had. I was at
first confounded, then enraged, to witness the conduct of
that black-hearted villain, he little suspecting that I knew
him to be the very man that was in the room the day before,
dressed in disguise. How could I feel otherwise.
There he was lecturing me about duty, as if he had been
a saint. It is true, he sustained that character at home.
I had known him for many years as a leading man in the
very respectable church to which he there belonged.
Had I not been satisfied of the base part he was acting,
when I met him the day before in disguise&mdash;his hypocritical
lecture might have been beneficial. But I discovered
he was an arrant knave&mdash;a real whitewashed devil,
and I could with difficulty refrain from telling him my
thoughts. I left, wondering how such a Judas could go
so long "unwhipt of justice"&mdash;how he could avoid exposure.
Probably it was by a change of dress.</p>

<p>It was now time I had visited the hospital, to show
reason why I had not fulfilled my engagement on the
previous evening. The colonel received me with a welcome
countenance, and remarked, he "was glad I had
returned, for," said he, "I feared you had gone away."</p>

<p>I told him I was weary when I went home; that after
supper I had laid down to rest a few minutes, and slept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>longer than I intended, and that was the reason I had not
returned. He was satisfied with my excuse, and introduced
another subject. He inquired if I had heard any
news, or seen any of the Lawrenceburgh citizens; and
if so, had his name been mentioned? I replied, that it
had been the principal topic of conversation, some speaking
well of him, and others illy. He then wished to
know, who had spoken evil of him? I told him the
man's name.</p>

<p>"And he talked about me, did he?" inquired the
colonel.</p>

<p>I replied, "He has spoken very hard things against
you, alleging that he never associated or had any dealings
with you."</p>

<p>"He told you, he never had any dealings with me?
What did you think of that?"</p>

<p>I answered, "When you resided in Lawrenceburgh, I
was too small to notice such things."</p>

<p>I answered thus designedly, for I had seen him walking
arm and arm with the colonel, time and again, but I
was afraid to let the colonel know that I had even a moderate
share of sagacity.</p>

<p>"Green, how often have you seen him," continued the
colonel, "and where, since you have been in the city?
You know his son said, he had returned home, a few
days since, when you carried him the letter."</p>

<p>I told him I had not seen him before, since I came to
the city.</p>

<p>"Are you certain of that?"</p>

<p>"I am confident I have not seen him."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said he, "you met him yesterday."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew what he meant, but dared not let him know
that I had recognised him. Again he interrogated me:</p>

<p>"Do you not recollect him?" at the same time eyeing
me with an intensity of expression. I replied that I was
certain I had not seen him.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said the colonel. "You met him
here yesterday. He was the man that remained after the
doctor had left."</p>

<p>"It cannot be," I rejoined. "You must be mistaken,
as I was certain that man had light hair, nearly red."</p>

<p>"It was him, Green," said he. "He had a wig on,
but for your life mention not a syllable of this to your best
friend. He is a villain of the deepest dye, and I know
him to be such."</p>

<p>I, of course, agreed that I might have been mistaken.</p>

<p>"He knew you," continued the colonel, "and was the
worst frightened man I ever saw, for fear you would recognise
him. I am glad you did not, for it might have
cost you your life."</p>

<p>"I suppose, then, colonel," said I, "he intends furnishing
you with bail, does he not?"</p>

<p>"He did not manifest such a determination, did he,
when you met him?"</p>

<p>I replied: "He might have had his reasons for acting
as he did; it may be, it was to find out whether I knew
him as the person I met here yesterday. You say, colonel,
then, I actually met him yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the very villain. I know enough about
him to make him stretch hemp, if he had his dues."</p>

<p>I told him he was esteemed by many, where he lived,
to be a very good man.</p>

<p>"Yes, they respect him for his riches," said the colo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>nel;
"but they would not respect either him, or many of
his neighbours, if all knew them as well as I do."</p>

<p>After this, he proceeded to give me the promised advice,
and addressed me thus:</p>

<p>"Green, I believe you are a good boy, but have been
imposed on by the world. I am about to give you some
advice. I feel it right I should do so. I am in bad
health, and can never recover, and my only object in procuring
bail was to secure a decent burial, but I have no
hope. Green, I tell you this, that you may know the
condition in which you are placed. You are surrounded
by a set of devils incarnate, and you know them not.
You are just entering upon a life of misery and crime.
You can now see, to a limited extent, what has caused
me to lead a wretched and abandoned life. As soon as
you can, leave this place. You know not your danger.
You have about you some desperate enemies. I have
told the most inveterate of them, that they were mistaken
as to your character."</p>

<p>I here inquired what they accused me of.</p>

<p>He continued, "Of being treacherous to one of the brotherhood,
of which my brother is a member."</p>

<p>"I never knew before that such a society existed,"
said I.</p>

<p>"They accuse you of three different crimes. You
know whether there is any foundation for the charges.
First, that you agreed to swear against Taylor; then,
after the spurious money was placed in your hands, you
gave the facts to Taylor's lawyer, and that your evidence
will now be used in his favour. If such is the case, I
advise you to abandon such a purpose, for you will certainly
lose your life if you persist in this thing."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>I denied to him any such intention.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "what have you done then with those
five one-hundred-dollar notes given you by one of the
assistant attorneys of my brother?"</p>

<p>I replied, "They are in my chest."</p>

<p>"If such is the case, it will make every thing satisfactory
in that matter."</p>

<p>I now left, and went to Mr. Munger, and related the
substance of my late interview. He handed me the
notes that I might make good my declaration. I took
them immediately to the hospital. When I entered I
found two merchants, who resided at Memphis, in close
conversation with the colonel. He told me to call again
at two o'clock. About that time, I returned. The visitors
were gone, but the colonel appeared much distressed.
Some new event must have added to his former
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I wish you," said he, "to bring those notes and let
me see them."</p>

<p>Having them in my pocket, I presented them to him.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have them. You have been strongly
suspected of foul play&mdash;of giving them into the hands
of the defendant."</p>

<p>I was well convinced from this, that it was one of the
clan who had rummaged my trunk and pockets a few
days previous. I then asked him, what else they had
laid to my charge?</p>

<p>He replied: "A man by the name of Sandford gave
information to my brother, that a certain amount of money
had been hidden by him. Sandford died, and gave the
money to my brother, and gave directions where he could
find it. My brother prepared a note for his wife, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>told her where she could find the money, and my brother
reached the note to the wrong person." [See <span class="smcap">Gambling
Unmasked</span>.] "Some person told him you were
the receiver; that they had seen you take the note."</p>

<p>I knew, however, that no one had seen me take it, that
the whole was a mere conjecture&mdash;a plan to worm a confession
out of me. Hence I denied it stoutly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it myself," affirmed the colonel,
"but the whole clan, remember, dislike you; among
others, a negro trader, by the name of Goodrich. He
has marked you out as a transgressor, and is determined
to put you out of the way." I have mentioned this same
Goodrich, once before. He is well known as one accustomed
to sell runaway negroes, as a kidnapper, who lives
with a wench, and has several mulatto children, and
probably does a profitable business in selling his own
offspring.</p>

<p>I replied, "I do not know Goodrich, and know as little
about Sandford's money."</p>

<p>"Well, Green, I believe you are innocent of the two
first accusations, and hope you may be of the third."</p>

<p>But now came the "tug of war." These others were
only a preparatory step for a fearful inquisition. I knew
what was coming, and mustered all my fortitude to meet
the exigency. If ever there was a time when I was
called upon to summon my collected energies, to express
calmness and betoken innocence, it was on this occasion.
The colonel, fixing his eagle-eye upon me with severest
scrutiny, proceeded:</p>

<p>"A certain package of papers has been taken, which
has produced a great excitement, and has caused me
serious injury." When he mentioned <span class="smcap">papers</span>, there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>a sensible pause, and a piercing look which exhibited a
determination to detect the slightest expression of guilt.
I was enabled to command myself, however, in such a
way, that I think I satisfied him I was not guilty.</p>

<p>In reply, I asked the colonel "Why they should accuse
me of acting so base a part?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for you," said the colonel, "you have
been seen talking with the friends of Taylor."</p>

<p>I replied, "Perhaps I have, for I cannot tell who are
his friends, or who his enemies." I likewise asked him
if he thought it possible I could or would do any thing to
injure him.</p>

<p>"I think not," said he, "yet mankind are so base and
deceitful, I have but little confidence in any one. I will
now show you how dreadful must be my position in regard
to the package, and then you can understand why
its loss will go so hard with me."</p>

<p>I listened with the utmost attention, and he entered
upon this part of the subject as follows:</p>

<p>"I am a member of a society called '<span class="smcap">The Secret
Band of Brothers</span>.' It is an ancient order, of a religious (?)
character. The leading members carry on an
extensive correspondence with one another. All letters
of business are subject to the order of the one who indites
them, allowing the holder the privilege of retaining a
copy. I had many letters written by leading men in my
possession; besides a large package of copies. These
with the original letters have been taken. Now, Green,
you promise secrecy, and I will give you the whole plan,
so far as in my power, and you can then judge how seriously
I shall be affected if those papers are not recovered.</p>

<p>"At the time of my arrest, on the charges for which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>am to be tried, my friends were numerous and wealthy,
and I had the utmost confidence in all their promises.
The excitement was intense, and I did not deem it proper
to call upon them until it should subside. After waiting
a suitable length of time, I wrote to many of my acquaintances,
and, among others, to several whose names are
familiar to you. They were under personal obligations
to me, aside from the common claims of friendship. They
had made their thousands by plans of my own invention,
and much of the very wealth which had given them distinction
and influence was the fruit of my ingenuity. To
my letters they made ready and satisfactory replies.
They made the largest promises to give me any requisite
assistance, when called upon, yet as often left me in suspense,
or to reap the bitter fruit of disappointment. This
was the reason why my trial was put off during several
sessions of the court. My brother having been indicted
with me, made the prospect of both more dubious. I had
property, but not at my disposal. My wife betrayed my
confidence, for having it in her power to send me pecuniary
aid, she neglected to do it; indeed, all her conduct had
a tendency to involve me in the net that was spread for
my feet. Through her, information was given that I had
friends who would assist me, which served as an excuse for
her dereliction. This awakened the suspicions of community.
There was an anxiety to know who would step
forward to my rescue. Hence those from whom I expected
aid became alarmed, lest their characters, which
had hitherto been unblemished, should come into disrepute.
Two of them are merchants in Dearborn county,
Indiana. Some five of the most wealthy men of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>county were driven almost to desperation when they learned
that my wife had it in her power to use their names in
connection with deeply dishonourable acts. I, however,
satisfied them that she would not expose them, and they
in turn promised to assist me, writing several letters of
commendation in my behalf, giving me an untarnished
character as a merchant of high respectability in Lawrenceburgh.
From time to time they promised to secure
me bail, and yet they as often failed to make good their
word. In this they violated the most solemn obligations.
We were pledged to sustain each other to the last farthing,
in case either became involved in difficulty. That pledge
I had never broken, and I looked for the same fidelity on
the part of my associates. I never before had occasion
to test their sincerity, but found all their solemn promises
a mere 'rope of sand.' I found I was gone, as far as
they were concerned, and turned my efforts in another
direction."</p>

<p>"I now had recourse to my friends in Chillicothe,
Cleaveland, Buffalo, Detroit, Zanesville, Beaver, Lexington,
Nashville, Philadelphia, New York city, Boston,
and Cincinnati. As usual, they gave me the most liberal
promises, but in no case fulfilled their engagements. I
was now driven to new measures. I found those in
whom I reposed the utmost confidence hollow-hearted
and treacherous. I next entered upon the plan of making
a certain villain share in my wretchedness and disgrace.
In this I was joined by my brother, who, in perfecting
the scheme, acted somewhat imprudently. I advised
him to take a different course, but he listened to
others who professed to befriends to us, and were, indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>members of the same fraternity,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but turned out the worst
kind of enemies, especially those who were wealthy.
The poorer members were true to a man, and I am confident
will remain so; and if I am spared, I will make the
wealth of the others dance for their vile treatment. I
have a thousand men who but wait my call. When I
say the word, though they are of the same brotherhood,
yet having also experienced the treachery and oppression
of the higher class in common with myself, they will
make war upon them whenever the signal is given."</p>

<p>Here he stopped for a few minutes, and then began to
state the little trouble it would have given his friends to
have aided him if they had felt disposed.</p>

<p>"But I am an invalid, and God knows I do not deserve
such treatment." (The reader may think it strange that
such a man should call upon his Maker, especially when
he reads the constitution of the secret conclave, of which
he was a member. The phrase "God knows," was used
often in his private conversation.) "These persons I
have always considered my friends, and have never given
them occasion to be any thing else. Finding, however,
that I had no hope from them, and that I must stand my
trial, I was willing to make use of other means. I therefore
agreed to proposals made by the most wealthy of my
friends, and yielded to their arrangements, in order, if possible,
to escape punishment. There was a man by the
name of Taylor, the same whose trial is now pending,
whom they feared, and who was known to community as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>an accomplished villain. He was the person selected
upon whom it was designed to heap the burden of the
guilt. By that means, the attention of our prosecutors
would be diverted. The plan was set in operation, and
soon the infamy of Taylor was sounded from Maine to
the confines of Texas. They had their agents in almost
every city to help on the work. From the first, I had
but little hope of success in this man&oelig;uvre, but consented
reluctantly to the trial. I was confident he had many
enemies, and not without cause. Having been foiled in
all my former plans, I now experienced the deepest anxiety.
I was especially solicitous that as long a time
should elapse as possible before he was arrested. Some
time after the report of his guilt he was arrested, and my
brother promised to secure evidence to prove him guilty,
and likewise to establish my innocence. It was also
agreed by the committee of arrangements at that time,
that I should take medicine upon a feigned sickness, in
order to secure a change in my situation. In this way I
could be removed to the Marine Hospital, when reported
by the committee of health as being in danger. I was to
appear ignorant of my brother's design, of which in truth
I was. I took medicine, which had the desired effect.
It made me desperately sick, producing excessive prostration.
Application was made for my removal to the
place where you now see me. Being conveyed hither,
arrangements were made for my bail by my supposed
friends. I was persuaded that I should continue in this
state of unnatural disease from that time till the present.
My brother carried on his treacherous part, and it required
no little effort to convince the community that Taylor was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>really guilty of what was charged upon himself. Although
he was known to be a desperate man, yet the
charges were of such a nature, it was most difficult to
sustain them. My brother's main dependence was in
the fraternity. He founded his hope of success upon a
concert of action among so many, apparently reputable
witnesses. Some of them would be used in behalf of the
state, and consequently receive regular pay for time and
services, and at the same time could employ a false testimony
against Taylor. Two objects could be thus secured;
first, they would be detained as witnesses and used as
necessity required; and, secondly, be ready to make up
my bail. My brother further gave community to understand,
that he would be able, by the production of certain
papers, to convince them of all that had been rumored
against Taylor. For this end, a quantity of papers were
forwarded to this city, among which were some bearing
my name, that were mere business letters. The ordering
these letters was not approved by me. It was a plan of
my brother. When it was discovered by several of my
most intimate friends, they became alarmed, thinking I was
concerned in the affair. As the fraternity required, by their
constitution, that all letters should be returned at the request
of the author, permitting the holder to take a copy,
it became my duty to comply with this requisition whenever
made. There was a great alarm. Many visited the
city with whom I had held correspondence, whose letters
had never been returned. They learned as to the disposition
that was to be made of the papers, and report said
we were about to give each individual's name concerned,
as we were intending to turn state's evidence. This ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>counts
for the many different visiters you have seen.
You also saw several from Lawrenceburgh, and the very
man you said spoke so disrespectfully of me, and gave
you the long moral lecture, is here on the same purpose&mdash;the
same individual you met two days since, whom you
designated as having light hair."</p>

<p>I here found his strength would not permit him to
pursue the narrative further, and upon his promising to
resume and finish the subject the next day, I left the
hospital.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>In returning to my boarding-house I was met by the
blackleg pettifogger, who treated me with great coldness.
I met him again the next morning at the prison, and he
treated me in like manner. But I was especially anxious
to hear what more the colonel had to say, and hastened to
his room. He began his account where he had left off.</p>

<p>"This man, who was dressed in disguise, was greatly
alarmed, lest certain of his letters in the package should
come to light, which had not been retained. He started
for home, as stated by his son, but returned to secure his
letters. You have witnessed the tremendous excitement
which exists, the running to and fro, and the many
strange visitors that frequent my room. There is a cause
for all this which I will now relate.</p>

<p>"My brother sent for those papers, which, upon arrival,
were submitted to his wife that she might select the most
important to be produced as testimony in court against
Taylor. In accordance with directions, she examined
them all and laid aside all the business letters, (meaning
the package lost,) which in some way have been mislaid
or stolen. These, you are accused of having taken, and
also of having taken a note that was reached through the
grate by my brother, as he supposed to his wife, but it
proved to be some other person, and they suspected you
as that one. They also charge you with giving information
as to the man who gave you five hundred dollars,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>and also that he used my name, saying at the same time,
'If you will swear that money on Taylor I will make you
a rich man,' and that you concerted in this thing to act a
deceitful part."</p>

<p>I replied: "I promised to take the money and swear
according to directions, but it was not for any respect I
had for the man who offered me a bribe, or the pecuniary
compensation, but for you and your brother."</p>

<p>"Green," said he, "have no respect for my brother.
He has not an honest heart. He would betray his own
father, and be sure that you refuse to do what the pettifogger
has advised." (See a full account in Gambling
Unmasked.) "Green, take care, or you will lose your life.
You have enemies that watch you closely. They also
watch me, but I cannot help myself. I wish you well and
believe you innocent."</p>

<p>This last was uttered in a suppressed and pathetic
tone, and I perceived his eye was intently fixed upon
mine as if he would read in its expression the secret
workings of my heart. I was determined he should not
effect his purpose, and managed to evade his glances.</p>

<p>"I am aware of their foul intentions," continued he,
"but know not how to evade it. Green, I have all confidence
in you as an honest boy, and do not think you
would do any thing to injure me, but have thought you
might have had a curiosity to know the contents of some
of those letters, and have mislaid them with the intention
of giving them back when you had read them."</p>

<p>I again protested my innocence, and solemnly declared
I had no knowledge of the package.</p>

<p>"Then," exclaimed he, "I am a doomed man. There
is no hope, and I will tell you the reason why.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know I have had many friends calling upon me,
day by day, from all parts of the country. You have
seen among them some of the most wealthy in the town
of Lawrenceburgh. They are my sworn friends and all
members of a Secret Society, which obligates each one,
under a most solemn oath, to assist a brother member out
of any difficulty, provided he has not violated his obligations.
Now my brother has acted most imprudently in
pledging himself to produce certain papers, and to bring
other witnesses besides himself against Taylor. These
men were apprehensive that we had mutually laid a trap
to expose the whole band. This has involved me in the
most unjust crimination. I am subjected to the charge
of conspiracy, and hence you see how difficult it is to
procure bail. It is true I have had promises from all
parts of the Union, but my brother concerted, without reflecting
upon the consequences of his conduct, to bring
one thousand men, if necessary, to this city, who would
be ready to do any thing he might direct. These men
were brethren of the same band, but of a lower order,
none of whom were possessed of wealth or extended influence.
The others, who possessed both, were kept in
silence, for fear of being betrayed or proving false to the
fraternity of which they were members. That we are
circumstanced as you see us at present, is not for the
want of friends. They are abundant and powerful; we
have them on sea and on land, and they are ready to assist
us out of any difficulty, and would do it in a moment if
assured that all was right on our part. You see the city
is full of them&mdash;many have come to secure their letters,
which they knew were in my possession, and if exposed,
would bring upon them certain ruin,&mdash;but alas! they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>have come too late. You will notice I have had no
visitors while I have been giving you this history. I
told the steward to admit none but yourself. Be assured,
Green, I have many friends, but they dare not act&mdash;they
dare not help me and they dare not convict me.
You may live to know the truth of what I am stating."</p>

<p>I inferred, from the last remark, that he had reference
to the judiciary. I had noticed that during his two days'
conversation, no person had visited the room but the
physician and a certain judge who lived near Florence,
Alabama, and the latter remained only a few minutes. I
found out his name by seeing it written upon his hat
lining, which had been placed upon the window opening
on the piazza. After the judge had retired, the colonel
resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"I am accused by my friends with treachery to the
brotherhood. They think that I, in concert with my
brother, have laid a plan to clear ourselves by their downfall.
When the news was out that the papers were lost,
I saw the most marked indications of hostility. They
came forward and pledged to bail me in any amount, provided
I would return their letters, but swore that I should
never go from this room alive, if I did not produce them.
I am certain to suffer death. My sentence is fixed, and I
have no hope. My brother and his advisers have ruined
me. They have had me borne hither that I might not
understand their plans. I am satisfied the papers are in
the hands of the intimate friends of my brother and those
who had manifested such an interest in my removal to
this place. I have been reduced by medicine, and my
inability to exercise&mdash;so contrary to my general habits&mdash;has
seated a fatal disease upon my lungs."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>His disease had been occasioned by the constant use
of medicine, which exposed his system to cold, and this,
by constant repetition, had entirely destroyed his constitution.
I have no doubt that a slow poison was mingled
in his medicine. When he had finished this tale of sorrow,
he gave me some affectionate advice in something
like the following words:</p>

<p>"Green, I advise you to leave the city as soon as possible.
There are two parties of the 'secret band' that
seek your life; those who are so much enraged at the
loss of the papers, because their reputation, fortunes, and
lives, are thereby in jeopardy, and those who are the personal
friends of my brother, and who support him, do or
say what he may. They take his word with the infallibility
of law and gospel, and are by profession great
friends of mine, as well as of the other party, who swear
they will have those papers at all hazards, right or wrong;
meaning if you have them, they will obtain them in some
way; that if I have them they shall be returned. I therefore
advise you to leave the city immediately."</p>

<p>I told him I had no funds.</p>

<p>"I have not one dollar," said he, "to help you off, or
I would give it to you."</p>

<p>I told him I was under great obligations for his kindness.
He further remarked:</p>

<p>"Now pledge me secrecy to what I have related, for
it can have no effect in assisting you, and will ruin me."</p>

<p>I did so, and bade him farewell. I hastened to see
Mr. Munger, and told him what the colonel had said about
the counterfeit money and the money I had found by
Sandford's note, but not a word as to the mysterious
package.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>Shortly after the events detailed in the foregoing
chapter, I had a conversation with Mr. Munger, who told
me, he was satisfied that my life was in danger, and advised
me to leave the city for a few weeks, or, at least, to
change my boarding-place, and keep myself in seclusion.
Accordingly, I changed my quarters as soon as possible.
I could not well leave the city, as Mr. Munger informed
me I must be present to appear in court when Taylor
was tried, in case the younger brother acted the part he
had promised; and if not, it would be equally important
for me to be on hand, as they intended to indict him and
his pettifogger, for their wicked designs upon the man
they were endeavouring to ruin. As I could not go far
out of the city, under these circumstances, I considered
it more safe to remain concealed: I waited, therefore,
several days, until the colonel's death, which occurred
not long after I bade him farewell.</p>

<p>I had met Cunningham&mdash;the old man at first charged
with having the package by Mrs. Brown&mdash;several times
after the colonel had advised me to leave the city, and in
our last interview, he gave me to understand that the
colonel would never get out of his bed alive, or leave the
hospital, except when carried to his burial. I asked him,
why.</p>

<p>"There are many reasons. His health will never be
any better; he cannot recover from his present illness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
I know it is hard, but there are many who think it is
preferable that one should suffer than thousands, who
consider themselves better men. He has brought this
trouble upon himself, by not living up to his oath. He
and his brother are both traitors, and have placed the
fraternity, of which they are members, entirely in the
power of their enemies, but it will all come out right;
there is no mistake. You heard that Madam Brown
had lost a certain package of papers, letters, or the like,
did you not?"</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Well, they believed for a time that I had them, or
would have made others think so; but that kind of accusation
would not take with men who knew me. They
next laid the charge against you: I have satisfied the
interested party, that they are not in the possession of
either of us, but that the colonel and his brother have
them, and intend thereby to slip more necks into the
halter than poor Taylor's. I am of the opinion, their
own necks will pay the price of their treachery."</p>

<p>I then replied, that I knew Mrs. Brown had said she
had lost a package of papers, but what they contained, I
knew not.</p>

<p>"Nor ever will know," said he.</p>

<p>"I have no curiosity about the matter," I replied.</p>

<p>"And you might as well <span class="smcap">never</span> have, for curious people
will pay dearly for reading them, especially if they
undertake it in court, as evidence against the brotherhood."</p>

<p>The reader can hardly imagine the intense desire that
was created, by this time, in my heart, to learn all about
this "brotherhood," and "fraternity," so often intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>duced,
and yet so obscurely as to give me no certain information.</p>

<p>I took this opportunity to ask Cunningham, what title
this society had assumed; whether they were Masons or
Odd Fellows? He laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"I thought I had explained some of the particulars to
you." He then stopped, as if to consider, when he continued:
"Certainly, Masons and Odd Fellows both, and
all other good institutions&mdash;but, I can tell you, Green, the
brother who has turned state's evidence swears terrible
vengeance against you. Do you be careful. He has
many who are watching you. I belong to the party opposed
to him and the colonel, and they throw all the
blame upon you. You are the victim of their suspicions
and hate, and you will do well to leave this place without
delay; but tell no one, by any means, that I have given
you this information."</p>

<p>I bade him good day, and we separated.</p>

<p>I now thought I would call once more, and see the
colonel. I hastened to the hospital, but as I drew near,
I discovered two men riot far from the steps, and the third
coming down. I walked by them, without being recognised,
and as I passed, the third man had entered into
conversation with the other two.</p>

<p>He was asked, "Is it a fact, that he is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. He has been dead about three
hours."</p>

<p>"I knew," said one, "that he could not stand it long."</p>

<p>Two of the men, I perceived, were from Lawrenceburgh,
the two who stood remotely, one of whom was the
identical person who wore the wig, and gave me such
good fatherly instruction. I passed to the room, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
I found the steward, with three assistants, laying out the
corpse.</p>

<p>"We do not wish any more assistance at present,"
said the old French steward. I understood his meaning,
and left immediately.</p>

<p>The news of the colonel's death soon spread through
the city, and many gathered to witness the burial, but
owing to the inclemency of the weather, few followed to
the grave. When the hearse bore the body away, it
rained very hard. I did not make my appearance on the
occasion, for I well knew that many would be present to
relieve their anxious minds&mdash;to rejoice rather than mourn
over the dead, and who would sooner see my dead body
deposited by that of the colonel's, than any other on earth.
I was determined not to be mourned for in that way, by
the desperate villains. I therefore kept aloof from their
society.</p>

<p>Several days elapsed, during which time I remained
in concealment from all the clan, but Cunningham, who
expressed a concern for my welfare. I also had frequent
conferences with my friend, the deputy-marshal. Three
days after the colonel's death, Cunningham informed me,
that he was convinced that both of the Browns deserved
death.</p>

<p>"But I dare not tell you why," said he, "and if I
should, you would not be able to comprehend my reasons.
Be assured, if they are guilty, the other brother will
never come from that prison alive. He will find out, that
the brotherhood are wide awake."</p>

<p>All his insinuations were perfect Greek to me, for some
weeks after; but when Taylor had his trial, the whole
matter was explained. Their import I will now unfold.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>From the time the plan was concocted, for making
Taylor suffer the penalty of another's crime, the utmost
promptitude was required for its execution&mdash;the machinery
must be actively employed by the friends of the
colonel, and his brother. First, the colonel must be made
sick, and a sympathy thereby awakened, and hence the
plea for his removal would be the more plausible. His
enlargement was important. He was a principal man,
with whom it would be necessary to have much consultation&mdash;an
intercourse more vital to the cause of his pretended
than his real friends. Besides, there were many
who really desired his escape, but being among the first
class of society, as to wealth, respectability, and influence,
they were unwilling to frequent the prison to visit
the unfortunate colonel. Though interested deeply in
his release, they were not willing the public should understand
that they were sworn friends. The part the
younger brother was to sustain, has already been detailed
in a former chapter. The medicine was administered
with the desired effect, and the colonel was removed to
the hospital. He was now in a situation to be consulted.
Many would now visit him, who never would have gone
to the prison. If a reason was required for their familiarity
with so base a man, it could be found in the dictates
of kindness, called forth by suffering humanity.
After his removal, his brother was under obligation to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>as he had promised, to produce the spurious plates, the
counterfeit money, and the correspondence, and swear
them upon Taylor, as the real agent and proprietor. As
the signatures of the letters were anonymous, other testimony
was required to establish the real author.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the plates and letters were
in Canada for safe keeping, and must be sent for, and
conveyed to the city before the trial of Taylor could proceed.
In the mean time, jealousy and consequent dread
on the part of the colonel's confederates were daily receiving
new strength. Conscious were they of having acted
a most dishonorable and deceitful part with one of whom,
under ordinary circumstances, they were accustomed to
stand in awe; but now they were more especially apprehensive
of danger, because there was a provocation for
seeking vengeance. They knew he had every means to
involve them in a more signal overthrow than that which
awaited himself. The only alternatives were, either to
wrest the weapons of destruction from his hands, or
render the possessor incapable of wielding them. They
were driven almost to desperation, when they reflected on
their deeds of wickedness reaching through many years,
the record of which was in the hands of a powerful and
justly provoked enemy, who in a day might spread out
for the gaze of the world the portraiture of their former
characters, in which were mingled the features of darkest
villany and the more glaring expressions of open violence
and crime. Goaded on by an awful apprehension, they
were prepared for any thing that might save themselves
and families from exposure and disgrace.</p>

<p>Colonel Brown was a Grand Master of the band of
Secret Brothers. The members of the fraternity who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>sought his ruin were of the same degree, together with
those holding the relation of Vice-grand Master. He had
nothing to fear from the common brotherhood, who were
kept in perfect ignorance of the transactions of those more
advanced. Indeed, they were his warmest friends, and
regarded him with especial reverence, because he commended
himself to their confidence and esteem by his
naturally good disposition, and, most of all, by his relation
of Grand Master, which is always accompanied either
with dread or marked respect. The inferior order was
very numerous, but seldom wealthy, generally of a suspicious
character, who had no fixed residence, but wandered
from place to place, preying upon the community in the
character of bar-keepers, pickpockets, thieves, gamblers,
horse-racers, and sometimes murderers. They may be
found in all parts of the United States and Canada.
These were controlled by some two hundred Grand
Masters, conveniently located, who were generally men
of wealth and respectability, and often connected with
some learned profession, yet but seldom applying themselves
to their profession sufficient to gain a livelihood.
These men, of both orders, would often confer together,
especially when one had been detected in any crime&mdash;or
some dirty job was to be done, which was likely to bring
into the hands of the superior order any considerable
wealth. In fact, these so-called respectable men would
lay plans which they dared not execute for fear of detection,
but having any number of agents in readiness among
the common brotherhood who had nothing to lose in point
of character, they would employ them, and if successful,
be sure to pocket all the spoils&mdash;except enough to satisfy
the immediate wants of their jackals. If they were not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>successful, but detected in their villany, these unfortunate
agents could lay claim to their aid, and were permitted
to make drafts of money to procure bail in case of indictment
or to defray the expenses of a trial. We have sometimes
wondered that certain felons should get clear, when
their guilt has been established beyond a doubt. We will
not wonder when we learn that there are men of wealth
and influence in almost every town, who are sworn to aid
and befriend these villains. They are sometimes lawyers,
and jurors, and even judges. But their conduct
and relations will be more clearly seen, when I publish
their letters and constitution. It is only necessary to
remark in this connection, that the only persons really
benefited in this organized system of land piracy, are
their Grand Masters. They lay most of the plans,
and receive and control the money,&mdash;confer among themselves,
but never with a common brother, only using him
as a tool for the accomplishment of some foul purpose.
Here is policy. It would not be safe to commit their
secrets to the many hundreds under them, but only to
such as are judged suitable after years of trial, and those
beneath are often looking forward for promotion, which
is a pledge of their fidelity. The reader will perceive
that if this higher order was ever to be fully exposed, it
must be by some one of their own number, for one of an
inferior degree knows no more of their proceedings than
the uninitiated.</p>

<p>The danger of a full exposure now threatened them in
connection with Colonel Brown; at least they apprehended
it. They knew they deserved it, and the circumstances
of their accomplice pointed in that direction.
He had the means&mdash;their own letters, and a knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>of their deeds. It was only necessary to give information
to a third person, and the work would be done. Besides,
he was a man of extensive acquaintance and
influence&mdash;a ruling spirit among his fellows. A revelation
from him would have been direful in the extreme, as,
in addition, he had in his possession the constitution and
by-laws of the fraternity, which were always lodged with
the ruling Grand Master. Under these circumstances
we need not wonder that there was excitement, that every
expedient was employed to rescue the documents or make
away with their possessor. He was now in confinement.
It was vital to their designs to keep him there till they
could secure the letters and constitution above referred
to, or, in case of failure, make his life pay the forfeit.
They cared but little for his brother, as he was of an inferior
grade. The Grand Masters, then in office, had but
one object in view, and that they were intent upon accomplishing.
The acquittal or conviction of the two
brothers was a matter of no consequence compared with
their own personal safety. To secure this they would
not scruple even to commit murder. That this is the
case, will be seen by an article in their constitution. I
may further remark in this connection, that their laws
required, that the Grand Master shall be assisted by six
Vice-grand Masters, but these latter cannot be admitted
into the secrets of the former till they are promoted,
although they are obligated to do his bidding. The
members who had been advanced to the highest degree,
and hold the principal secrets of the order in connection
with the colonel their leader, were about two hundred.
These were the individuals conspiring against his life, in
case they could not procure their letters and other docu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ments.
Their main and first object was, therefore, to
bring those papers to the city.</p>

<p>The papers were sent for, as before stated, and all their
designs, of a public and private nature, set in active operation.
Of this the colonel had no knowledge at the
time. Mrs. B. was to give them up to the committee
appointed for the purpose of inspecting them. All that
would have any tendency to injure or expose the fraternity,
if brought to light, were to be selected, and the
rest brought forward for the purpose of convicting Taylor.
The intention of bringing these papers to the city being,
in the mean time, made known to the colonel, he gave
directions to his sister-in-law to reserve such papers as
he specified, and hand the balance over to the committee.
The trunk in which they were deposited having arrived,
Mrs. B. acted according to directions, reserving the notable
package which she concealed between her beds, while
she conveyed the residue to the prison office for legal
purposes&mdash;to be used by the committee, who met there
by consent of one of the prison keepers&mdash;he being a
Grand Master of the secret band and one of the principal
policemen. After delivering up the papers, she returned
and found her valuable deposit had been removed as
previously stated.</p>

<p>The fact of their removal being made known to the
brotherhood, they thought some base person had robbed
the lady of her important charge. This opinion prevailed
with the fraternity generally. Not so with the
two hundred grandees. Their opinion assumed the character
of their former suspicions, while their suspicions
were converted into fact. They were now fully convinced
that the colonel contemplated the destruction of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>their order, and was intent upon keeping the papers in
his own power: that he had even entered upon the act
of defeating the very purpose they had in view, in bringing
those papers to the city. At this time the city was
crowded with the members of this secret society, and
private rewards were offered by the two hundred or that
portion of this band then in the city, for the recovery of
the papers. These rewards made a great stir, especially
with the officers of all parties, both those for and against
the colonel. Taylor was a mark to be shot at by about
seven-eighths of the band, and the remaining one-eighth
was ready to go to the highest bidder, to do service for
him who would give the highest wages. He found
means to secure the friendship of the latter, many of
whom were considered quite respectable men, and were
never suspected by the brotherhood of any thing dishonourable.
The head men constituted still another party.
Thus these villains were divided into three factions.
These were the friends of Taylor, known as Taylorites,
and the supporters of Brown, called Brownites. These
only were publicly known; while the third party, embracing
the royal grandees, were actively engaged in disengaging
themselves from the coils which they supposed
had been deliberately laid for their destruction. They
showed, by their efforts, they had more at stake than all
the rest. Though their movements were not publicly
recognised, yet they had every influence that would favour
their cause in operation, to consummate their hellish
purposes.</p>

<p>The constitution, by-laws, and about one thousand and
three hundred letters, including copies and original, were
missing; and the destiny of the whole band of Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Masters depended upon their recovery, before ever they
fell into the hands of one who could explain them to the
brotherhood; and still more calamitous would be the condition
of the entire fraternity, if they were ever revealed
to the public. Those more immediately concerned were
confirmed in the opinion that the colonel had secreted
them for future use. Finding they had not accomplished
what they intended, in bringing the papers to the city,
they had recourse to a certain clause in the constitution,
to compel the colonel to produce some of them, if in his
possession. That clause required the holder of an original
letter to return the same, when requested by the
writer, after copying, if desirable. This law applied,
however, only to letters having the secret "qualities,"
or, in other words, the private description of the bearer
in full, which was written in acid, and could be read only
after subjection to chemical action. Three hundred and
seventy-nine of the letters in the package were of this
kind; one thousand were copies, whose original had
been returned. The former had been written to the
colonel, and one bore date as far back as July 9th, 1819;
the latter had been addressed to various individuals, and
some bore date as far back as 1798.</p>

<p>To secure these letters was a work of great delicacy.
Though the constitution granted the right of asking the
unreturned letters, yet the writers feared to make the
requisition of the colonel, lest he might suspect them of
a conspiracy, and being thus exasperated, let loose his
engines of destruction. They finally fixed upon the following
plan. They were to hold out the idea that they
were ready to bail him, provided he would leave the country.
In case he consented, they were to request the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>retention of the letters, feeling confident he had not destroyed
them. The plan was laid open to the colonel by
the man from Dearborn county, Indiana, the same who
was dressed in disguise. He was told by the colonel
that the papers (meaning the package) had been taken,
and he could not furnish them, as he had no possible
knowledge who had done the deed. This reply, to the
council of Grand Masters, was like "a clap of thunder
in a cloudless sky," so confident were they that he had
them and would produce them when thus requested.
There was now only one alternative, the life of the colonel
must be taken, which they could and did accomplish, as
the sequel will show.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>From the time of the visit by the Dearborn county man
till the death of Colonel Brown, embracing about six
weeks, there were constant and fierce wranglings among
the fraternity. A considerable change had been made
in the feelings of some of the colonel's former sworn friends,
which of course made those who knew him innocent
more bitter against any one they might suspect guilty of
bringing such a calamity upon him. His friends and
foes were equally interested in finding the retainer of
the lost package, but all to no purpose. There was, however,
but one sentiment in the Grand Council; they still
believed that the colonel had them, and designed, as soon
as he was liberated, to make a general exposure of the
whole organization to the world. But their own consciousness
of personal injury&mdash;of having acted a treacherous
part against this man&mdash;was, in reality, the ground of their
conviction as to his guilt; for it was not in the nature of
the man to be false to his pledged honour. It only remained
that they should prevent his liberation; and the
most effectual way was to act in accordance with the
assassin's maxim, "Dead men tell no tales." Their
hatred rose to such a pitch that they began to exhibit
their enmity toward any one that either sympathized, befriended,
or was even familiar with the colonel. Here
was the ground of their deadly animosity toward me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
They supposed I was his confidant, and might be an
agent for the execution of his designs.</p>

<p>These murderers,&mdash;(I ask no pardon for so harsh an
epithet, for they were such in thought and deed,)&mdash;these
Grand Masters, who visited the colonel while I waited
upon him, and thus became personally known, have, ever
since that event, assumed a hostile attitude toward me.
It is true they have never attacked me publicly, yet I am
confident they have hired others to do it. From the time
I drew the money put in deposit by Sandford, and bore
off that object of curiosity, so carefully concealed in the
bed, until the day I was chased as a mad dog by an infuriated
mob through the streets of New Orleans, and finally
made good my escape through a troop of less hostile cotton
snakes, as recorded in my Gambling Unmasked, I
was singled out as an object of open and private hate by
the whole tribe of organized desperadoes. To recover
those papers, no steps were too desperate for the Grand
Masters&mdash;they having any amount of money to accomplish
their object; and I am now about to present the reader
with another exhibition of their daring and indefatigable
perseverance.</p>

<p>They now came to the conclusion that those papers
had been given to the officers of the bank, and were deposited
in the clerk's office of the United States court, to
be used against them at some future day. They offered
rewards to several of the inferior grade, for the purpose
of getting possession of the box containing the plates,
counterfeit money, and, as they supposed, the lost package.
Their only hope now lay in getting that box. The
time of Taylor's trial had been fixed. Mr. Munger informed
me I could leave the city for a few days, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>would let me know when my services were wanted. I went
to Bayou Sara, one hundred and fifty miles above New
Orleans. A few days after my arrival, Mr. Munger came
after me in great haste, bringing the information that a
great and daring burglary had been committed the same
night I left the city. The clerk's office had been entered,
and the box, containing Taylor's indictments, plates, and
spurious money, had been taken. Taylor's jury had not
agreed, and he would get clear, in case the box could not
be recovered. He informed me that I had been suspected
and accused of the deed; but that he knew I was innocent,
for he had inquired of the boat, and found I had left
on the previous night, some time before the robbery was
committed. He did not wish any one to know that he
had any knowledge of my location, but told me I had
nothing to fear. Indeed, I knew I could prove an <span class="smcap">alibi</span>
by more than one person, and I consented to return.
While on our way back to the city, I told Mr. Munger I
did not wish to go into the prison where the younger
Brown was confined; I feared he had some designs upon
my life.</p>

<p>"Do not have any apprehensions," said he, "on that
account. You will not be hurt, for you will be put into
the debtor's apartment, where Brown is not permitted
to visit, and of course can have no chance to do you an
injury."</p>

<p>I was placed in prison upon my return&mdash;a position of
greater safety to me than any other. Being assured by
Mr. Munger of protection, I went without hesitation&mdash;expecting
to be released the next day. The next morning
I was brought out and informed, to my great surprise,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>that if discharged I must furnish a very heavy bail. This
was a source of alarm; but my friend calmed my fears,
by saying that all would be right when I was examined;
that the excitement was great, and it was only necessary
to wait for the return of the Lady of the Lake&mdash;which
was on a trip to Natchez, and would be back in a few
days&mdash;when abundant evidence in my favour would be
secured, and I would be acquitted.</p>

<p>In a few days, I was accordingly set at liberty. The
plates and papers had been found in Natchez, and a man
by the name of King had been arrested&mdash;who confessed
the crime, but alleged that he had been hired by a certain
party to do the deed. This King was one of the brotherhood,
and had been employed by the committee of Grand
Masters to enter the office and secure for them the box,
by which they expected to obtain the package. In this
they were mistaken, and placed in a worse dilemma than
before.</p>

<p>On the day of my discharge I was visited by a man,
to me unknown. He informed me that he had procured
my acquittal, and was my sincere friend and well-wisher;
that he desired always to remain the same&mdash;and would,
during life, on condition that I acted in accordance with
his wishes.</p>

<p>I considered him a strange person, to introduce himself
in so singular a manner. He advised me to leave the
city as soon as possible. I told him that was my intention.
I likewise informed Mr. Munger of the same, and
he readily consented, as Taylor's trial had been put off.
Arrangements being made with him, I expected to leave
the next day. In the mean time, I had an interview with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Cunningham, who told me I must look out, for the brotherhood
in general suspected me of foul play as to the
papers. I denied all knowledge of them&mdash;for I found it
my only safety to pursue one uniform course.</p>

<p>He continued: "The party are determined to have
them at all hazards, and are now more convinced than
ever that you are in the secret. All the circumstances
are against you&mdash;more especially since the custom-house
was broken open, which robbery was perpetrated for the
express purpose of finding the papers. It was thought
if the colonel had disposed of them, they would be found
there; but now they will hold you responsible. I bid
you farewell."</p>

<p>On the same evening I had this conversation with
Cunningham, I went with Smith to the gambling-house:
the same day, too, on which I won seventy dollars in
the flat boat&mdash;the first and dearest money I ever won at
gaming, as it nearly cost me my life&mdash;the full account of
which is given in the work previously mentioned.</p>

<p>On the second day after this, as I was about leaving
for Mobile, I met the gentleman who had procured my
release. He advised me to depart forthwith, promising
to meet me at another time. As we were separating he
placed in my hands a box.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "is a box, containing something I
wish you to keep with great care. You must not open
it till I give you permission."</p>

<p>I took the same. It was a small box, made of oak,
three inches high, eight long, and five wide. Its possession
gave me much uneasiness for twelve years&mdash;during
which time I remained faithful to my instructions. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>frequently met with my benefactor. The last time I saw
him was in Philadelphia, in 1841. I have received from
him nine letters, in all, of a good moral character, and
always referring to the box. This individual's name I
have never been able to learn. No two letters ever bore
the same signature, but the identity of their contents convinced
me they were all from the same person. That
mysterious box I have preserved to the present day.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by the reader that I confided
the papers, taken from Mrs. B., with a man by the name
of Watkins. This individual died with the cholera, in
1832. I called upon his wife for the package, who returned
the same to me at Cincinnati, in 1833. I found
every thing as I had left it, excepting the blank parchments.
They were gone. Here was a mystery I could not solve.
How should a part be missing and not the whole? I
never gained any satisfactory information until last summer.
While travelling through the state of New York,
I had occasion to visit the state's prison, where I met with
a certain convict who passed by the name of Wyatt, but
whose real name was Robert H. North. He gave
me information about a certain "<span class="smcap">flash</span>," or comprehensive
language used among professional gamblers and
blacklegs. Many of the phrases were familiar, but I
never could ascertain their origin. He was soon convinced
of my ignorance, and then informed me of the
society whence they originated. He likewise explained
the reason why I was so persecuted by the notorious
Goodrich. "It is known," said he, "wherever the fraternity
exist, that you obtained the package; but they
are satisfied you destroyed the same, and it is well you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>did, or else you would have been put out of the way long
before this."</p>

<p>I told him I had taken the package, but there was nothing
in it save letters and a few blank parchments.</p>

<p>He laughed and said:</p>

<p>"If you had <span class="smcap">warmed</span> those parchments, they would
have presented an exhibition worthy of your attention."</p>

<p>This information made me restless with excitement and
anxiety to peruse those letters and notes which I still had
in my possession. I may here remark, the letters were,
for the most part, unintelligible to a common reader, because
of the secret language in which they were written.
I had examined them again and again, without much
satisfaction. I knew they were penned for the purpose
of clandestinely carrying on a wholesale plunder&mdash;a deliberate
imposition upon public and private rights. By
frequent perusal I had become familiar with many of the
terms which were often explained to me by those who
were acquainted with their use, though they are used by
thousands, without any knowledge of their origin.</p>

<p>After I commenced an exposure of the vice of gambling,
I was often attacked by certain low, vulgar editors in a
manner that indicated deep-seated malice. I could not
account for their abuse. They would admit that society
should be rid of the evil in question, but at the same time
exhibited the most bitter hostility to me as one who had
dared to expose the abominations of gaming. I was conscious
there was something that moved them in their
work of calumny not yet developed. The mystery rendered
me unhappy. I was anxious to know the cause
of this public opposition, and the more so, that I might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>satisfy the people that the whole arose from influences
akin to the vice I was labouring to destroy. The secret
was soon discovered, and I am now prepared to satisfy
the public mind that the attacks upon my present relation
to society have arisen from something more than an
ignorant prejudice. These hireling editors knew I had
the materials to draw their portraits at full length in all
their moral hideousness; and they feared society would
be thrown into spasms at the sight, and they would be
hurled from their stations of trust by an enraged and insulted
people. It has only been necessary in one or two
instances to give them a few hints of the information I
possessed, and they were hushed up <span class="smcap">instanter</span>.</p>

<p>A long time had elapsed since I heard from the mysterious
stranger who gave me the box,&mdash;long enough, I
had supposed, to free me from obligation of further restraint
upon my curiosity. It had now been in my
possession several years, and I felt myself at liberty
to examine its contents. Having consulted with a few
friends previously, I then made known, in the fall of
1842, to Rev. John F. Wright&mdash;formerly of the Methodist
Book Concern, Cincinnati&mdash;that I had such a box,
and my intentions. I likewise gave the same information
to Arthur Vance&mdash;formerly of Lawrenceburgh,
Indiana&mdash;Mr. John Norton, of Lexington, Kentucky&mdash;Thomas
M. Gallay, of Wheeling, Virginia. I informed
each of them how I came by the box, and the unaccountable
conduct of the man who placed it in my hands.
Having opened it, I found the same number of parchments
I had missed from the package, all blank in appearance.
In these was a note, which read as follows:</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">"The parchments, now in the hands of the possessor,
contain much sad intelligence, and can be read,
provided they are heated. They are exposed by a
brother of the band, a doomed man, one the world
has known to its sorrow for forty years. May the
owner and holder consider the doomed one a most
kind friend for ever!</span></p>

<p>"New Orleans, May 3d, 1832."</p>

<p>I soon hastened to ascertain the contents of the parchments,
and found the statement made correct.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>The contents of these papers are such as almost stagger
belief, even in the most credulous. They not only go to
prove the existence of a league of villany, but also laid
open the machinery by which their wickedness was concealed;
still, from many incidents of my own life, and
from what I have learned by observing events which
have transpired around me, as well as from narratives of
undoubted truth which I have heard, I am constrained to
believe that the band above alluded to does now exist,
and that it has flourished for a long time, with astonishing
power.</p>

<p>I have reason to suppose that many of the band settled
in and about Lawrenceburgh, Indiana; and from the year
1800 to 1827, they were very numerous, and some of
them wealthy; they were mostly close traders, who
turned every cent they got, honestly or dishonestly, into
real estate. Many of them, also, were well educated,
and composed the <i>aristocracy</i>, while the <i>poor honest</i> man
was crowded down by these <i>influential members of society</i>.</p>

<p>There are now three classes of wealthy men in that
neighbourhood: the honest, whose property was obtained
fairly; the members of the band; and some, of whom I
am doubtful whether they belong to the band or not. If
they do not, they are villains by nature, and do not need
their assistance.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1846, I delivered a lecture at Lawrenceburgh,
in which I exposed this band, and showed the
manner in which their correspondence was carried on.
The old members of the band had art enough to persuade
the doubtful rogues that they were the persons alluded
to, and they believed it. Whether conscience had any
thing to do with their belief or not, I do not pretend to
say; but the community generally seemed quite ready
to grant them that honour. It was very amusing to notice
the difference between the conduct of the guilty and that of
the innocent, in relation to the exposure. The "Brotherhood,"
all at once, were very much concerned about the
fair fame of their neighbourhood&mdash;called me a slanderer,
and in fact caused a much greater excitement against
themselves than would have occurred, had they kept
still; while the honest citizens quietly asked for the
names of the "brothers," and whether any of their relations
belonged to them; they begged me to go on, and
expose every member.</p>

<p>Since 1802, many robberies have been committed
under circumstances which strongly indicate that such a
band existed. Public agents, and other highly respectable
citizens, have been robbed of funds which they held
in trust, and no trace of the robbers could be found, and
no curiosity seemed to be excited by the fact. Sometimes
the person robbed shared in the spoils, and sometimes
they were innocent; and it has sometimes happened
that the innocent man was suspected. The honest
citizens of Lawrenceburgh have, for forty years, known
what a curse it is to have bad neighbours.</p>

<p>During the excitement occasioned by my lectures above
mentioned, a resident of Lawrenceburgh related the fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>lowing
incident, which is only one among many which
might be named to show the nature of the transactions in
which these men engaged, and their facilities for carrying
them out. I will give it as nearly as I can recollect
in his own words:</p>

<p>"During the year 1832, a stranger came into the town
of Lawrenceburgh, and for several days was noticed in the
public places watching every one who passed, as if looking
for some one. At length he came to me, and told
me that he wished my assistance in the business on
which he came, but that it would be necessary to keep
the matter secret. I answered, that if it were proper, I
had no objections to secrecy. He then related the following
facts as introductory to his business.</p>

<p>"He resided in Ohio; some eighteen months previous
a friend had been induced to purchase a large drove of
hogs for the market; he made the purchase on credit,
with a promise to pay when he returned. While he was
preparing to start, Daniel and James Brown bargained
and contracted for them, to be delivered at a certain landing
on Lake Erie, at a certain day, at which place and
time they promised to meet and pay him. He gathered
his drove, and proceeded to the landing, where he arrived
several days before the time appointed. He was there
met by some men, who told him that Brown had been
there, and left word for him to drive the hogs to a landing
two or three days' journey further on, where he had
made arrangements to butcher and pack them. He went
as directed; he found neither of the Browns there, but
found the men who had directed him before; they informed
him that they had orders to commence killing and
packing the hogs, and that Mr. Brown would be there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>that day, or the next. He consented, and the hogs were
killed and packed. A merchant at the landing advanced
money to pay the man, and also furnished salt, and barrels
on credit. On the day that all was finished, the two
Browns arrived, bringing with them another large drove.
They pretended to be very much surprised to find our
friend there, and much more so to find the hogs butchered.
They declared that they had not bargained for the
slaughter of the hogs, and that they contracted for them
in another place, and would have nothing to do with
them here; that he had broken his contract, and they
should demand heavy damages. He sought for the men
who had directed him hither, but they had dispersed as
soon as paid, and no trace of them was to be found. He
told the Browns how he had been deceived, but they
denied all knowledge of the affair, and again talked of
damages. The merchant then presented his bill for supplies,
and money advanced to butchers and packers. Our
friend not having the money, he seized on the pork.
What could he do? The case was desperate. He had
bought on credit; would his pitiful story satisfy his
creditors? His character was ruined. You may imagine
the state of his mind. At this crisis, the Messrs. Brown
took him aside, and told him that since he was in difficulty,
they were willing to befriend him, and to show
him how he could soon make money enough to pay off
his creditors. An oath of secrecy was required and given.
They then offered to settle the merchant's bills, which
were very extravagant, and pay him for the pork in
counterfeit money, at twenty per cent., with which he was
to buy stock through the country. In his despair, he consented;
a few days after he was detected, arrested, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>tried, under a false name, and condemned to the Ohio
penitentiary. His friends, remaining entirely ignorant
of his fate, began to suspect foul play. The Messrs.
Brown effected his pardon, and hurried him away; but
not before he had contrived to make known his story, and
the fact that he was under restraint among a band of bad
men, and that he could not escape without assistance.
He was never heard of more.</p>

<p>"The stranger gave me his address, and requested that
I would keep an eye upon the people who should come
there, and if I should see the Browns, or hear of his unfortunate
friend, that I should let him know. He had
visited Lawrenceburgh, because that was the former residence
of these two men, and he hoped to see them; but
being disappointed, he was compelled to go back to the
family of the lost neighbour without having received any
intelligence of his fate."</p>

<p>The reader will have seen by this time, that, probably,
the whole transaction was arranged before the man bought
the first hoof of that drove of hogs. Some emissary of
the Browns advised him to speculate in pork; to use his
credit, which was good, and he did not see the Browns
till he was preparing to start. They make him liberal
offers, because they never intend to pay, and it matters
little what they offer. He then sends some of the meaner
members of the gang to the landing, to order him a few
days' journey further, and there they meet him again, and
butcher, and pack the hogs. They are well paid for
their villany by the job, which they take care to make a
fat one. The merchant was paid for his part of the rascality
by the profit on his stores, and perhaps by a bonus
out of the money advanced. They then thought that if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>they could implicate him in any unlawful business, he
would tell no tales about them; accordingly, they entice
him, or rather drive him to the counterfeit trade. But
conscience makes bad men cowards, and they felt uneasy,
so, by means of some of the band, they have him arrested;
the proof is so positive that he must be convicted, and
the poor fellow was thrown into the penitentiary. But
even here they did not consider him safe, although under
a false name; so, through the influence of some of the
<i>aristocracy</i>, they get him pardoned; and then the moment
he is free, they meet him, tell him of all they have
done for him, and propose a new scene of action. Poor
fellow, what can he do? He goes with them to this new
scene of action, but in all probability he finds it a state of
<i>rest</i>, for "dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>Thus, for the paltry price of a drove of hogs, was an
honest man ruined, and, for fear of detection, murdered.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably in no era of the world, and certainly never
among a Christian people, was there formed a more bold,
daring, and, at the same time, secret association, than the
one whose constitution and by-laws we now present to
the reader. Composed of men of all classes and grades
in society, from the priest at the altar, the judge on the
bench, the lawyer at the bar, down to the most common
felon and street thief or pickpocket, all bound together
by a solemn oath, they laboured for the general cause of
secret plunder, to the enriching of themselves at the expense
of the mass. But having previously shown how I
procured my information regarding these desperadoes, I

and proceed at once to present their</p>


<h3>CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS.</h3>

<p class="rightheader"><i>Hanging Rock, Western District of Virginia,</i><br />
<i>July 12, 1798.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.&mdash;<i>Art. 1.</i> This society shall be known by
the name of the <span class="smcap">Secret Band of Brothers</span>.</p>

<p><i>Art. 2.</i> It shall be governed by brethren who have become
prominent by their many valiant deeds for the promotion
of the society.</p>

<p><i>Art. 3.</i> The officers of this society shall be known as
Grand Masters, and shall be duly authorized, by this constitution,
to initiate, as members of this society, any male
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>or female, who comes well and duly recommended by a
brother, in good standing, as having served the probation
which this constitution requires.</p>

<p><i>Art. 4.</i> It shall be the duty of a brother, before he
gives the applicant information who the Band of Brothers
are, to take him on probation three months, during which
time he shall notify the Grand Master, that at such a
date he will introduce the person, on probation, for initiation.</p>

<p><i>Art. 5.</i> It shall be the duty of the Grand Master to
notify all the Brotherhood, so far as he has it in his power,
that such an individual will pray for the privilege of becoming
a member of the Honourable Brotherhood, at such
a date; and to likewise apprize them of the duty set
apart, so far as in the power of each member, to carefully
scan the motives of the said candidate, and, if they can
ascertain by word, deed or action, that the candidate is
not a fit person to become a member, to convey the same
to the brother who recommended him, and the same must,
in all cases, apprize the Worthy Grand what has been
said against, and in favour of the said candidate;&mdash;and
it must be strictly observed, that in no case shall the
Worthy Grand condescend to be introduced without proper
notice; and the same must in all cases be strictly
obeyed.</p>

<p><i>Art. 6.</i> It shall be the duty of every member to make
the candidate the subject of trial, in every secret manner
which he may think profitable to test his qualities as a
true believer in the virtue of the Brotherhood; and likewise
to throw every temptation in his way, which may
be likely to sour his disposition against the formalities of
the world, and thereby lead him into a closer commune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with the Holy Brotherhood, of which he is to become a
member, and which he is to believe to be true and honest
in every sense of the word; and that all other religions
and creeds are base, and founded upon speculative
motives&mdash;that this is the only <span class="smcap">true</span>, by which he must stand
through good or ill, and never secede, on pain of death
on earth, and punishment eternal hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Art. 7.</i> It shall be the duty of every brother to be
strictly on his guard, concerning this brave and generous
band, and give no intimation to any mortal being of its
existence, unless he is fully persuaded that he or they
are worthy by thought and act of the high and honourable
character which the honourable body will ever confer
upon them, by receiving them as men and brethren,
worthy of the protection of the only true society under
Heaven.</p>

<p><i>Art. 8.</i> It shall be the duty of all, both members and
Masters, to guard against the influence of party spirit,
either political or religious, as termed by a certain class
of people, who, from their weak and shattered principles,
have been led to suppose that the great and overruling
Bible, among certain classes, is the Divine inspiration of
the Deity, and was hewn from a solid rock, for the purpose
of satisfying all men of the power of God, whom
this band hold sacred, as a being of unchangeable character,
who will, in the immortal state, prepare an everlasting
place of rest for all who do not by their oaths
confirm the total disapprobation of his supernatural
power.</p>

<p><i>Art. 9.</i> It shall be the duty of all brethren of this benevolent
band, in their becoming members of this Christian
(!) fraternity, to deny the principles of the book
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>called the Bible, to be other than the work of priestcraft,
got up to delude the weaker portion of mankind, and
whose principles have been carried out to the uttermost
parts of the earth, until even the heathen have suffered
by the base intrigue of missionaries, of this rascally compilation
of nonsense, by being made subservient to their
most outrageous and villanous transactions.</p>

<p><i>Art. 10.</i> That we do deplore the perversion of the
power of God, as men and Christians, and believe it
highly commendable to this, the only true society of
Christian principles, to associate and connect ourselves
with all churches, of every denomination, and with all
societies, not for the purpose of supporting them, but
through these means to the furthering of our own designs.</p>

<p><i>Art. 11.</i> That we labour to make proselytes of all with
whom we come in contact, when it can be done without
suspicion and danger to ourselves; that we believe this a
true principle&mdash;founded upon Nature herself, our ruler&mdash;that
policy dictates to us the necessity of keeping at peace
with the world, and often appearing humble and Godlike,
that we may be taken as pious and God-serving people:
at the same time, that we keep our "lights so shining,"
that all who wish, may be able to understand, appreciate,
and embrace our principles.</p>

<p><i>Art. 12.</i> That we hold, as a duty to mankind, that the
God of nature, the only God, has made a benevolent
donation to all his beings; and that it is against the principles
of true Christianity, to allow one man to fare sumptuously
day by day, while his neighbours, as good by
nature, and far better by practice, shall be made his servants;&mdash;and
therefore, we, the members of this honourable
body, do pledge ourselves to try, by every means in our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>power, to diffuse the necessaries of life throughout the
universe, that all may fare alike who live as Nature's
Christians.</p>

<p><i>Art. 13.</i> We pledge ourselves to take from the rich,
and give to the poor; and, as none of the honourable
body wish for more than the God of Nature has given&mdash;which
is an abundance of this world's goods&mdash;we agree
to take from the one, and give to the other; and that the
wealthy, or the enemies of this society, shall be the ones
we will strive to harass, by disapprobation of their tyrannical
course; and no respect will we pay to persons,
either politically or religiously, but swear to prove true to
all the bearings which we have laid down in this our
Constitution.</p>

<p><i>Art. 14.</i> We pledge ourselves to strive for the promotion
of the true principles as set apart by us, and to use
every means in our power to enlarge our institution, and
to abhor&mdash;save when dictated by policy&mdash;everything like
priestcraft, (such as may be found in that book, called the
Bible, in the twentieth chapter of Exodus, and known as
the "ten commandments," which were said to have been
written by the finger of God, and which have since been
the cause of nine-tenths of the crime against the welfare
of mankind,) and yet to take every means in our power&mdash;
knowing, as we do, that we are the only rightful Christians,
and few in number, in comparison with the other
denominations&mdash;to carry out our motives, as dictated by
policy, by linking ourselves to them by bonds of this same
priestcraft; in other words, to be, if possible, promoted
to the charge of their flocks, as priests or ministers; and
all advancement of the like shall be duly appreciated by
every worthy member; and the industrious and honest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>brother, so succeeding, shall be looked up to, and respected
as one of more than ordinary talent.</p>

<p><i>Art. 15.</i> We pledge ourselves to educate our children
so as, if possible, to prevent them from becoming members
of any society save that of the Holy Band,&mdash;known
as the Secret Band of Brothers&mdash;the only correct and
Christian people that strive to place all men upon an
equal footing,&mdash;and, furthermore, to destroy all principles
we may from time to time see developing in favour of
that class of people whom the world calls Christians, and
that we do sincerely feel it a duty we owe to ourselves
and the God of Nature, to try, by every means in our
power&mdash;and in this case all means shall be considered
justifiable&mdash;to overthrow all institutions which take the
Bible as their standard&mdash;as we hold that the God of Nature
has set apart for us three principles and no other.</p>

<p>First: That all men are made to live their time of probation
on earth, and are not answerable hereafter for any
deed they may commit, so it be sanctioned by the laws
or constitution of this society.</p>

<p>Second: That the course mankind in general pursues,
particularly the so-styled religious class of community, is
wholly contrary to our views, and therefore wrong; and
that the God of Nature, as our God, requires that we put
down the fabulous book called the Bible, to save mankind
from priestcraft and delusion, and bring them over to our
principles.</p>

<p>Third: That there is but one unpardonable sin, which
is, to allow Christians, our tyrants, to progress when we
can make them retard, by leaguing ourselves with, and
instilling into their minds, and more particularly their
offspring, all the noble sentiments which may tend to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>overthrow former prejudice and eradicate the present
false views of moralists, until the Bible shall be looked
upon by them in the light it now is by the followers of
Mahomet, and until all the present laws of society be considered
tyrannical and unjust.</p>

<p><i>Art. 16.</i> The God of Nature, we hold as our God, has
in no principle required us, through his wise construction
of our component parts, to be in any manner driven by,
or subject to man,&mdash;that He, as a wise, intelligent being,
created all mankind upon an equality, and that all men
should so stand in regard to each other&mdash;that no being
was ever placed upon this earth to rule as monarch over
others,&mdash;and, therefore, that all monarchies, all governments,
which are headed by rulers, such as kings, presidents,
governors, &amp;c., are unlawful in the sight of God,
and unjust&mdash;and that we, as men and Christians of the
Holy Brotherhood, do hereby pledge ourselves, aye, do
swear by all we hold sacred, that we will use all the cunning
of our natures to put down all kingdoms, all governments
which are ruled by crowned heads, presidents, or
governors, or ruled by any principle of religion other than,
nature&mdash;and that all religion, priestcraft, &amp;c., is unholy
in the sight of the Most High God, and that He requires
of us, as a paramount duty, that we labour zealously for
its final extermination, to the glory of Him and the benefit
of mankind here and hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Art. 17.</i> We hold that the foregoing articles are wholly
correct, and fully sanctioned by the God of Nature&mdash;that
whoever of our fraternity proves in anywise recreant to
them is a traitor to us, to himself, and his God;&mdash;that the
candidate for membership, in view of this, does by this
article most solemnly declare and avow that all the fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>going
are according to his most unbiased views&mdash;that
such, and only such, he will ever support, nor shrink,
nor waver from, nor expose the same, even in the agonies
of death, on flood, or field, in prison, on the rack, scaffold,
or feathered couch&mdash;that he understands this fully, and
all the bearings of it, with all of the foregoing, his name,
which he deliberately, without compulsion, sets to this
constitution, stands as lasting, undeniable proof&mdash;that he
has come to this solemn determination after calm, mature
deliberation&mdash;that he is over twenty-two years of age&mdash;and,
finally, that he is willing to go through with all the
oaths and ceremonies which this band sees proper to
impose; in proof whereof, he now repeats the following</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>PRAYER.</p>

<p>Almighty and all-merciful God! the Great Author and
Disposer of all beings! I hereby pledge myself, in thy
sight, to keep sacred the holy principles, one and all,
which I this day have had set before and disclosed to me,
by the Worthy Grand Master of the most ancient order
under heaven&mdash;known by the appellation of the Secret
Band of Brothers&mdash;and I pray thee, Almighty God! to
watch the workings of my cultivated nature; and, Heavenly
Father! keep me sane in mind, that I may always
know the everlasting punishment which awaits me, if I
prove recreant to the vows which I herewith do take
upon me, with my own free will, in thy holy sight&mdash;and
I pray thee, Almighty God! should I prove false to the
vow or vows I now make, in becoming a member of this
Holy Brotherhood, to shut from me the light of thy
countenance&mdash;to visit the wrath of thy indignation upon me&mdash;to
let my walks here on earth be paths of desolation, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>the end of which be famine and death, and, in the world
to come, torment and more tormenting pains racking my
soul for ever! But, Almighty God! should I keep and
carry out these, the only true principles, which thou in
thy wisdom hast set aside for thy children to follow, then
mayest thou be pleased to grant me a well-spent closing
life on earth, and an undying existence with thee in thy
holy kingdom of heaven!&mdash;Amen.</p></div>

<p><i>Art. 18.</i> The foregoing articles having been read and
acceded to by the candidate for membership, and the
prayer having been repeated by him, he shall be considered
a member of this fraternity&mdash;known as the Secret
Band of Brothers&mdash;and the Grand Master shall then proceed
with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Most worthy Brother! You have now been initiated
into some of the secrets of the Holy Brotherhood, otherwise
called the Secret Band of Brothers; you have become
a member of an Order which, I trust, you will ever
cherish&mdash;feeling it is worthy of any of God's children;
and, if you so consider it, and also consider yourself a
true and lawful member, you will now make the same
manifest by an inclination of your head, in token of assent,</p>

<p><i>Art. 19.</i> The member having bowed in assent, the
Grand Master shall again proceed, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, Brother, you, through choice, can take one degree,
which will entitle you to a benefit in sickness or in
distress; and likewise entitle you to the use of the <span class="smcap">scale</span>,
which will enable you to converse with any Brother without
any possible chance of detection, by paying the trifling
sum of twenty-five cents per month, to the Worthy Grand,
who is the proper person for you to apply to for assist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>ance,
which in all cases must be done verbally:&mdash;in token
of assent that you wish this degree conferred upon
you, you will now lay your hand upon your heart and
answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p><i>Art. 20.</i> After conferring the foregoing degree, the
Grand Master shall again proceed, as follows:</p>

<p>Brother, it is now my pleasant duty to inform you that
the degree just taken entitles you to a full membership
of the Holy Brotherhood, and also entitles you to a benefit
of thirty-three cents per day, if imprisoned, or confined
by sickness, caused by exposure or otherwise,&mdash;which
you, in all cases, must make known to the Worthy Grand,
if possible, through a Brother, but by no other process;
and you must be careful to observe one particular point,
which is, <span class="smcap">never</span>, under any circumstance, to approach
the Worthy Grand as an intimate acquaintance, for fear
of being suspected as such, and thereby bringing mistrust
upon him through some person who may have had their
eye upon you, as a man not carrying out the principles
which they approve of as being the ones best calculated
to promote their priestcraft.</p>

<p><i>Art. 21.</i> The Grand Master shall thus continue:</p>

<p>You being now a member of this Holy Brotherhood, it
falls to my lot to apprize you of the position which you
now occupy, and some of the duties incumbent upon you.
This society claims you as a Brother, and, should you be
sick, will prepare hospitable means for your comfort&mdash;should
you be in difficulty, through misfortune, you will
ever find friends ready and willing to assist you: should
you for any offence be brought to trial, your judges, jurors,
witnesses, &amp;c., you will find composed of men
selected from this Holy Brotherhood: you have the pri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>vilege
at any time to go and come as you please, to retire
or live in public life; but you are to make known every
transaction whereby certain classes may be considered
as dishonest&mdash;and if the person offending is not committed
by a Brother, you are bound, if possible, to see that the
offender is brought before the tyrannical bar, and, likewise,
if it lies in your power, to have the said offender
convicted; and, if convicted, it shall furthermore be your
duty to apprize the Grand Master the length of time he
is sentenced, to what prison, and what punishment&mdash;as
we, as men and Christians, hold it a duty for each member
to throw every obstacle in the way of the people
<span class="smcap">called</span> Christians, for the purpose of bringing them to
the laws which Nature's God has set apart.</p>

<p><i>Art. 22.</i> Having now informed you of some of the
benefits and duties falling upon you, as a Brother, I now
come to an article of penalty, which you will find requires
your close attention, as follows:</p>

<p>If you betray a Brother, this Constitution allots to you
but one punishment, which is&mdash;DEATH BY VIOLENT
MEANS!&mdash;<span class="smcap">and this sentence will surely be carried
into effect</span>&mdash;as sure as that there is a sun at noonday,
or stars at night; and the Brother, so terminating your
career, shall receive, in compensation, the sum of <span class="smcap">three
hundred dollars</span>, which shall be paid to him by a Grand
Master, for this society.</p>

<p><i>Art. 23.</i> If you are ever true and faithful to the Brotherhood,
you shall be sustained by them, in all your
undertakings, right or wrong; and should you meet with
danger, by reason of the Brotherhood, which sometimes
happens, by your making the same known to the Grand
Master, he will, if your quarterly and annual payments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>have been regularly made, refund you the full amount.
You will be charged, annually, five dollars for your head,
and a half cent per annum on all your common chattels
and freehold property,&mdash;which you will be required to
pay in advance, yearly, to ensure you the benefit and
full privilege of the Secret Band of Brothers' Mutual Insurance;
the principle of which is adopted for the special
benefit of the Brotherhood, as we feel no interest in befriending
any, not even our own blood relations, unless
with a motive of sooner or later bringing to bear our
Christian creed, and making them true and faithful
Brethren.</p>

<p><i>Art. 24.</i> If at any time you think it would be policy
for you to withdraw&mdash;or, in other words, retire&mdash;you will
find it beneficial for you to watch for, and detect every
species of fraud&mdash;done by any other clan than the Brotherhood&mdash;and
convey the same to your worthy Brethren;
and in all cases, do all you can to make war with what
the self-styled Christians call moral principles; and whenever
you see or hear of an imprudent act in a Brother, it
shall be your duty to convey the fact to the Brother&mdash;if
not by your own tongue, by that of some Brother of the
band,&mdash;and if you see any manifestations made throughout
the community of a moral, or, what is termed of a
religious nature, it shall be your duty to oppose and
oppress the leaders in every shape and manner possible,
as we hold all such calculated to keep in darkness
many who might, otherwise, be made true and faithful
Brethren, and followers of Nature's God: and the moral
part of the community, so termed, who will not give us
an opportunity to enroll their names, watch; and if by
aping them you can make inroads upon their creeds, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>false views, you will add not only to the promotion of
the society, but will sustain a character throughout the
Brotherhood, not to be forgotten; and, furthermore, as
there are many ways to find out the principles of men, it
is to be the constant duty of each member of this Brotherhood,
to take advantage of every opportunity of finding
out the opinions of the mass&mdash;by talking as much as possible
about the villanous transactions which happened at
an early day, in the new settlements, and the active part
which he took in detecting the band, &amp;c.&mdash;by which
means he not only learns who are friendly towards the
promotion of this Brotherhood, but also who are the ones
for this society to watch as their most deadly enemies;&mdash;
and a Brother must, in no case, refuse to give money for
the construction of the most popular churches, and must
always pay great respect to the priests&mdash;for through them
we hope to hide many of what might be termed, by our
enemies, deeds of darkness; but such as we, as men and
Christians, believe to be lawful and proper duties: and
one who does not comply with the rules and regulations
of this band so far as in his power, after having taken
the solemn oath, shall be treated by all honourable members
as unworthy of their protection, and shall be proscribed
by the Brotherhood&mdash;<span class="smcap">which proscription leaves
him liable to sudden and violent death, at any moment</span>!</p>

<p><i>Art. 25.</i> Each member who has been duly sworn in,
as Grand Master, can have the privilege of withdrawing
his name from the Holy Brotherhood, by recommending
one whom he considers worthy, and in whom he pledges
himself can be put unbounded confidence, and one who
has never failed to pay his quarterage and yearly dues
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>in advance; (as such a failure assuredly prohibits him
from promotion;) and this office grants to the holder his
travelling expenses, and two dollars per day, while on business
of the society, and, likewise, secures him double the
benefit of a private, in sickness or difficulty. Now, therefore,
Brother, you have the full meaning of the foregoing,
and the same chance of promotion as either of the Brethren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. <i>Art. 1.</i> The Grand Masters of this society
shall consist of six, to every fifty mile square,&mdash;five of
whom have no power, other than to bear the annual
returns, in case of absence or sickness of the principal
Grand&mdash;in which case they are entitled to his pay, for
their services and expenses&mdash;said pay to be deducted
from the moneys in their possession, at the meeting of
the society; and in case of death or resignation, the seat
or seats of the former Grand or Grands must be filled by
the next Grand or Grands, in rank&mdash;said rank to be
through the official age of the subordinates; whose seats,
as <span class="smcap">they</span> rise, must again be filled by some one of the
private members, whose appointment must be confirmed
by a petition, signed by three-fourths of the Brethren;
and, in case of two or more candidates running for the
same office, the one having the most names shall be
considered duly elected&mdash;whereupon he must solemnly
pledge himself to keep the funds intrusted to him, belonging
to the Brotherhood, secure; that should he, at
any time, be required to resign, by three-fourths of the
Grands, he will make due returns of all moneys in his
possession; and that, in all cases, he will be ready to
render a correct account of all moneys received and paid
out by him, which account shall, also, be duly made out
and handed in at every annual meeting.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Art. 2.</i> It shall be the duty of every Principal Grand
to keep his accounts, and the Constitution of this society,
written on paper, with a certain kind of acid, which cannot
be read, unless held to the fire, when the heat will
bring to the face of the paper the desired intelligence;
and it shall, furthermore, be the duty of the Grand Master
to commit to memory this Constitution and By-laws,&mdash;that
he may, at any time, be able to give any passage
verbatim, without the assistance of referring to the article
itself, as it endangers the Brotherhood to have the documents
on hand;&mdash;and it shall also be the duty of the
Grand Masters, in office, to supply the five, who are not
matured officers, with one article at a time, until they
commit the same to memory; when it shall be their duty
to instruct them the manner in which the same is written
in acid; and then to demand a written Constitution from
each, which, if not written correctly, must be corrected
and returned every three months, until perfected.</p>

<p><i>Art. 3.</i> It shall be the duty of the Grand Masters to
examine their five subordinate officers, four times each
year, until they find each capable of drafting a constitution,
and of giving each article its correct No. and proper
place,&mdash;with full instructions as to secrecy, in keeping
all the six words, with their proper tables, from the ordinary
members&mdash;as the ordinary members are not entitled
to the use of the six words, which are termed Qualities;&mdash;and,
furthermore, if any of the Grand Masters know
of a letter of importance, which one of the members has
written to a Grand Master or Subordinate Grand, it shall
be the duty of the said Grand Master, if possible, to
<span class="smcap">qualify</span> the letter, either upon the inside or outside, as
the case may be&mdash;for the qualities are highly essential,&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>and
it shall still, furthermore, be the duty of all Grand
Masters, to teach their Brethren the necessity of their
committing as much of the language as shall be given
them on their initiation; and, likewise, the great importance,
for the general safety, that all letters shall contain
as much of the secret language as can be made to answer
the purpose,&mdash;because it will be easily read by the Grand
Masters, and common members, but will be impossible for
the worldly people to unravel.</p>

<p><i>Art. 4.</i> It shall be further observed, that no Grand, if
known to reveal to any common member more than the
initiation prayer, and what has been specified in the foregoing&mdash;with
the exception of the meaning of the figure
9, in the fourth column, to which all are entitled&mdash;can be
thought worthy of the honourable Grand's station; and
in no case can such an offence be forgiven&mdash;and that, as
a punishment for such an offence, he shall not only be
discharged from the high and honourable office of Grand
Master, but shall have a vote of censure passed upon
him, which shall for ever disqualify him from holding
office; and he shall, thenceforth, be closely watched, and
in case he shows, or in any way manifests, any sign
of malicious disapprobation, he shall be tried in secret,
by the Grands and members of his District; and upon
three-fourths giving their opinion that he is an enemy to
the Brotherhood, it shall be the duty of the Grand Master
to take him on probation, six months, and apprize him
of the fact, that he is, in the opinion of the Brotherhood,
acting, or about to act, a treacherous part,&mdash;and that he
has been granted the state of probation, and the privilege
of leaving the District, or changing his treacherous principles:&mdash;if
he choose the former, his name must be sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>to every Grand Master in the Union; if he choose the
latter, his after good works must recommend him; but in
case he should refuse either, it shall be the duty of the
Grand Master to put upon his head the usual reward&mdash;of
a traitor, which is three hundred dollars, to whoever
takes his life, with the highest approbation which can
be placed upon the Brother, so doing, by his honest
Brethren.</p>

<p>[The following qualities are known and used by the
Grand Masters alone, the common members being wholly
ignorant of their existence; and thus it is, that these
grandees can so completely foil their followers, without
the least risk of the latter being the wiser. The qualities
are made for the special purpose of designating
each individual, and at the same time be entirely safe
from the least suspicion. When a Grand Master has had
the honour of promotion conferred, he is supplied with
the table of qualities; likewise the secret of correspondence
is submitted to his confidence, under an oath, the
penalty of which is death, if he, by word, deed, or action
develop, or by any means expose, the principles
of his special charge. After he has taken the solemn
oath, the chief Grand gives him the secret for preparing
the sympathetic ink, which is used upon all occasions
where one Grand is corresponding with another; and
where a Brother is about to travel, it is the duty of the
Grand Master presiding, in the district where he resides,
to give him a plain letter of recommendation, with the
private qualities in cipher, in a definite manner, that
the Grand Master who receives the same may not be
deceived; and ofttimes has the poor ninny carried in his
supposed letter his death warrant. As the secret of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>cipher is not known to any but those of the fraternity
who have been promoted above the ranks of the subordinate,
it leaves the latter completely in the hands of
their Grand Masters. But we would not have our readers
to understand, by our explanation, that it is our belief,
that the private qualities are always carried out to a letter,
as laid down in their constitution and by-laws; yet we
have no hesitation in saying, that we believe that the
members live more closely to their profession than many
of our Christian institutions; and that there are many that
walk as near the line of their profession as they know
how, we have every reason to believe from the daily
illustrations we have of depravity among us. We therefore
give you the correct qualities of the Grand Masters,
which are held entirely apart from the common Brotherhood,
by the preceding restrictions set forth in this
note.]</p>

<p><i>Art. 5.</i> The Grand Master shall be fully invested with
power to give out the following catalogue of useful flash
words. The six words of <span class="smcap">quality</span> are highly beneficial
in conversation, and must, in all cases, be used when one
is present who is not known to be a member. By this
means can be found out the strange Brethren, who are
ever ready for any sound so familiar to their ears. The
dualities, also, serve to advance the Brethren, who are
made acquainted with them, to the higher seats of honour,
and are as follows:</p>

<p>First: <span class="smcap">Huska</span>&mdash;a flash word, signifying <span class="smcap">Good</span>&mdash;is fully
described by the subjoined numbers, the signification of
which is annexed:</p>

<p>This last number is one which will prohibit whoever is
entitled to it, from holding the high and honourable office
of Grand Master; and whoever is known to sell or give
intoxicating liquors to a Brother, for the purpose of making
him subserve to his avaricious purpose, shall be
highly censured, and made to pay over double the
amount which the victim has lost. If a Brother sees
proper to distil, or vend intoxicating spirits, and at the
same time notifies the Brethren, when they call on him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>that he does not make and sell the same for any other

the Worthy Grand; and it shall be highly reprehensible in
any Brother to converse with any coloured Brother, upon
any business pertaining to the Brotherhood; and all such
shall lay themselves liable to a vote of censure&mdash;as the
man of colour is not admitted for other purpose, than to
carry out deeds thought highly honourable, but which
many worthy Brethren dislike to execute, but for which

<p>This last number is considered in a different light from
any of the others. When a cross is placed over it, it
signifies that the Brother bearing it has been a martyr in
the great and noble cause of Equal Rights; or, in other
words, that in performing his duty as a freeman, he has
been seized and cast into prison by the tyrants of the
world: and it shall be considered a deed worthy of censure,
for any Brother to mistreat, or throw any obstacle
in the way of another, who may be entitled to the cross
over the figure 9, in the fourth line of Quality;&mdash;and all
members, both officers and privates, are entitled to know
the meaning of the mark over the figure 9; and if any
Brother says he is entitled to said mark, all Brethren are,
in a measure, bound to believe him&mdash;as it will be expected
that no Brother will be base enough to attempt a deception

<p>These private Qualities are not to be explained to any
but Grand Masters; and when a Brother becomes familiar
with these private dualities, he can correspond with
other Masters, without any fear of detection, as all of the
Qualities, though apparently simple, are impossible for
any one to understand, unless he has the key; and he
who shall <span class="smcap">dare</span> to instruct another in this mystery, unless
entitled to it by the law of our constitution, will find it
would have been better for him had a mill-stone been
tied about his neck, and he been cast in the bosom of the
deepest sea.</p>

<p>[The table of "flash" words contained in article sixth,
section second, are words used among the fraternity in
general, and by the common members believed to be the
only secret language of the order. In this they have
been kept wholly ignorant, by the cunning of their leaders.
We have but little doubt in our mind that there may
have been a great many words added to the original vocabulary,
since the adoption of the constitution, as we find
among the gamblers, and other dishonest men, language
entirely incomprehensible to all without a key. The
gambler, though not anywise connected, stands in his
profession ready to conciliate them in their works of
death, under the horrible idea that Nature, as their God,
has plainly sanctioned the profession. And the religion
of Nature they aver to be the only true religion on earth.]</p>

<p><i>Art. 6.</i> It shall be the duty of the Grand Master, upon
the initiation of a member, to supply him with a list of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>flash words used by the Brethren of this society, and shall
likewise inform them of the great importance, for the
safety of the Brotherhood, that they commit the few words
given them to memory,&mdash;which they will also find of
great importance in conversation and correspondence&mdash;as,
in the few words which are diffused in their respective
places, no person, without a complete key, can explain
or interpret their true meaning. The words adopted are
but few, yet answer, with common language, to enable
the Brothers to converse with ease without being understood
by others concerning their business, or matters and
things pertaining to the Brotherhood. It likewise enables
a Brother, in common conversation, to designate another;
or, in addressing thousands, he may be identified by, as
it were, accidentally using any one word of his discourse
in connection with the Brotherhood:&mdash;the latter, however,
is never to be done, unless in extreme cases. The most
essential service is in conveying the meaning, which, in
all cases, must be done in its proper place.</p>

<p>If you wish to ascertain if a Brother be present, you
can easily do so by <span class="smcap">sounding</span>. <span class="smcap">Sounding</span> signifies <span class="smcap">feeling</span>,
or <span class="smcap">ascertaining</span>; and if you wish so to do, use the
word <span class="smcap">Culley</span>, which signifies Brother, Friend, Partner.</p>

<p>As Nature, in every feature, dislikes a traitor, no provision
has been made for dissembling. This society is
ruled by Nature, as our God!&mdash;and it is the duty of each
and every member to do all in his power to promote the
welfare of his Brethren, as, by so doing, he must in time
convince all observers that the Secret Brothers are the
only true Christian sect on earth; and this we, ourselves,
individually and collectively, believe; and we make this
manifest, by placing our names to this scroll, and thereby
pledging our fortunes and our lives to maintain and carry
out these principles in all sincerity and truth; and should
we ever offer to take up another faith, and renounce this,
may our prayer-oath be fulfilled to the extent of all its
agonies; aye, and more: we now again doubly pray, that
if we ever offer to secede from this, our religion, that we
may thereby seal our immortal state with an undying
existence in a world of torment, prepared for all priestcraft
and treacherous mortals.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The singular circumstances connected with my obtaining
these papers, and the awful obligations contained in
the constitution, will prepare the reader for some strange
developments. The constitution, although not elegantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>worded, proves its author to have been a man of uncommon
shrewdness, and knowledge of human nature, and
forethought. We may therefore expect that the plan of
operations should be so laid as to baffle detection by ordinary
means. I will try to give some idea of it.</p>

<p>It was necessary that letters should be transmitted from
one member to another, in a distant location, yet the person
to whom the letter was addressed might be miles from
a government post-office, and it might not be safe for him
to present himself for a letter, lest he should be recognised
as a desperate man, and letters were liable to be
opened and their desperate projects exposed. To avoid
this danger, they established a line of communication,
extending from Toronto, Canada, to New Orleans. Not
precisely direct, but lying through large towns.</p>

<p>On this route were post-offices; consisting of hollow
trees, caves, cavities in rocks, &amp;c. Those who wished
to send letters deposited them here; with full directions.
All the "brothers" knew these post-offices; and when,
in their travels, they came near one, were bound to stop,
and examine the letters. If they found letters directed
to persons on their route, they must carry them along.
If the letter was directed to a person beyond the extent
of his journey, he must at least carry it to the next post-office,
if he was going so far; and from that, some other
Brother would pass it along. It was death, in all cases,
for a member to open a letter not directed to him.</p>

<p>As Brothers are constantly passing along the line, in
both directions, considerable despatch was secured. If
a letter should chance to be lost, it was written in such a
manner that one not knowing the secret would suppose
it to be an ordinary business letter, and the persons alluded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>to were so mentioned as that only the individual to whom
the letter was addressed, or some person interested in the
same transaction, could understand the allusion.</p>

<p>The person to whom the letter was addressed must
return the letter, if requested, but might keep a copy.
Along this mail line lived many of the Brotherhood, and
as they knew each other by signs, and were able to converse
in a <i>flash language</i>, unintelligible to the community
generally; when we recollect that they were bound
by solemn oaths to aid and defend each other in every
emergency, right or wrong&mdash;that both men and women
belonged to the order&mdash;the reader will see what security
a villain could enjoy when hunted by the police; how
easily the <i>respectable</i> citizen, the country merchant, the
lawyer, the captain of a steamboat, could conceal the
fugitive, and put the officer upon the wrong scent.</p>

<p>In addition to this caution, any thing which must be
so explicit that a stranger to the order might understand,
if he should see it, was written with sympathetic ink,
which would appear only when heated, and would disappear
again when cold; and even this was written in
a perfectly unintelligible cipher, to which, however, I
very fortunately found the key among the letters. I
insert it for the benefit of the curious.</p>

<p>One of the most profitable branches of their business
was that of <i>trading in horses</i>. For this, as will be seen,
their combination gave them peculiar facilities.</p>

<p>One of the <i>common</i> robbers steals a <i>horse</i>, rides it fifty
or a hundred miles, and offers it to a <i>respectable</i> robber,
called a <i>trader</i>. If it do not appear a dangerous bargain,
he makes the transaction as public as possible; he takes
a bill of sale, and enters it on his books, and the common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>robber goes on his way rejoicing. Presently the owner
comes along, and <i>claims the horse</i>. The <i>respectable</i>
trader is very much astonished at the discovery, but
makes no resistance. The owner, rejoiced to find his
property again, gladly pays the expenses of keeping and
goes home. But the respectable trader is very sure to
have not the slightest clue to the whereabouts of the man
who sold him the horse, and although it was done so
publicly that the owner cannot have a doubt of the innocence
of the trader, yet, strange to say, nobody knows
which direction the thief took, even when he left the
settlement.</p>

<p>Lest some member should get another into his power,
it is provided in the constitution, that for every transaction
they shall "pass" or exchange receipts. This gives to
each the same power, provided they are both of the lower
grade. That is, whoever has bought a stolen horse of
some member of the band, can be proved to have done
so by the thief, from the receipt; and the thief in like
manner is in the power of the trader. Again, it is of
importance to the poor robber to have a receipt from some
eminent trader, since it gives him character as a man of
business, and serves as a letter of introduction. They
are written in the usual form of an ordinary business
transaction.</p>

<p>The Grand Masters, who, alone, it will be recollected,
have the secret of using sympathetic ink, and the cipher,
always add to the receipt, with invisible writing, the description
and character of the individual who bears it,
thus holding the poor fellow completely in his power.</p>

<p>But should a poor scamp get caught, and lie in prison
a year or two, he is entitled, by the constitution, to thirty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>three
cents per day for the whole time. By the same
constitution, also, he is directed how he must proceed to
get it. He proceeds, therefore, in due form, as follows:
Going to the Grand Master of the district in which he
was convicted, he addresses him thus:&mdash;"Most worthy
Grand Master, I have this day come before you, to
place my hand upon the seal and swear that upon &mdash;&mdash;
day of &mdash;&mdash;, in the year &mdash;&mdash;, I was confined in prison,
(or <i>by sickness</i>) for &mdash;&mdash; months and &mdash;&mdash; days; during
which time I have contracted the following expenses;
I therefore make my petition that such money as may be
my due may be given me for my assistance."</p>

<p>The Grand Master, or Grand as he is called, then asks
the following questions:</p>

<p>"How long have you been a member?</p>

<p>"Where were you initiated?</p>

<p>"To whom have you paid your dues?</p>

<p>"What evidence have you that such are the facts?"</p>

<p>If, then, the poor brother have not receipts proving the
transactions for which he was imprisoned, and further,
proof of his actual imprisonment, (or evidence of his sickness,)
no further notice is taken of him. But if he have
such regular proofs as are required, the Grand declares
that they have but a small amount of funds in the treasury.
But that the Brother may get his dues, he gives him
drafts upon the various Grands in the country, to the
amount of his dues. If the amount were five hundred
dollars, he would receive fifty ten dollar drafts upon
fifty Grands, scattered over the country, from Canada to
Alabama, and of whom, in all probability, he will never
see three; and they are payable to none but the person
in whose favour they are drawn. And "to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>assurance doubly sure," with sympathetic ink, the cunning
officer writes a full description on each draft, of
the age, size, complexion, profession, peculiarities, &amp;c.,
of the bearer, so that if he should undertake to send by
another, he would have his labour for his pains.</p>

<p>We have now submitted the constitution to the judgment
of our readers, as we found it, having only added
a few explanatory remarks, which we are enabled to do
from knowledge acquired in various ways; and we now
select from those letters which came into our possession
a few, written by some of the individuals noticed in this
work, which will throw additional light on the character
of the Band. The note to each letter is explanatory of
the language contained in the ciphers.</p>

the Grand Masters teach their subordinates to acknowledge,
for the purpose of finding out among them such as
they can have confidence in in carrying out any desperate
scheme; and likewise to prevent them from exposing
others, through their associations; and thus it is that they,
as brethren, feel no delicacy in acknowledging to a brother,

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;According to our agreement, I was

and my situation was very little better when I learned
you had been detained through the negligence of our

nor ever will have, so long as he makes use of so much
whisky. I exchanged the coney I had for four hundred
pounds of feathers, and left them subject to your order at
friend &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, grocery store, Lower Market street.
I called and took breakfast with the judge, and he tells
me times have never been so close upon the coney trade
since he resided in the city. I likewise called upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Irish friend, and the first word he spoke was an oath that
Cincinnati was bankrupted; that constant calls were continually
made by the boys, and not one dollar to accommodate
them with. I hope you will be at home before
I leave for Indianapolis, as I cannot remain long upon the
way, and I have many calls to make, and be there by the
20th, as that is the day appointed. Raise all the funds
you can, and I have no doubt every thing will come out
right. This will be handed you by one whom I recommend
strictly honest, as I have had recommended.

<h4>No. 3.</h4>

<p class="rightheader">Greensburgh, October 20, 1825.</p>

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;I have, as you see by this letter,
arrived at Greensburgh, having travelled several nights
over some of the roughest roads I ever placed foot upon;
my journey, otherwise, has not been so disagreeable; but
night-travelling always disagrees with me. I was joined
by our friend, the doctor, and his intimate friend from
Brookville. They tell me they have been absent from
Brookville twenty-one days. We met at our good old
friend's house, near York ridge. He is as pleasant as
ever, and full as religious, and paid me one hundred and
twenty-five dollars&mdash;squaring accounts&mdash;and traded me
two notes on our Madison merchant, amounting to one
hundred and thirty-five dollars, which are as good as gold,
as he endorses them, and I believe and know the principal
to be as good as any man in Madison.</p>

<p>The doctor tells me some of the boys have had a flare-up
in Buffalo; but that is nothing new, as our Canada
friends act very imprudent. He tells me since he left
us, that several cabs have been traced out, and no traces
of the workmen left which can injure any one party.
He came through Columbus, Ohio! He says they are
hard at work, but scarce of material, and no means to
procure it. I have not the least doubt but you might
find it profitable to go or send some one to supply their
wants, so we can make it very profitable. Our friends,
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, <i>take</i> Fort Meggs, and at Manhattan
(I have reference to our judge and the lawyer we met
in Manhattan, Ohio) have made out well with the horses,
taken them in the summer, and say they wish the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>would bring them one hundred head before the lake
closes. The doctor brought me a letter to that effect. I
leave this place to-morrow evening for the Forks of the

<p class="rightheader">Four Corners, October 24, 1825.</p>

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;I have arrived at the Four Corners,
where I was pleased to receive your favour of the 17th,
and having the good luck to learn that five of the brethren
of Virginia are in the neighbourhood, and would
leave to-morrow evening for their homes by the way of
Lawrenceburgh, I make ready this and forward it by
them for the purpose to inform you that our friend
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, the cooper, cannot, without my consent, have
any more stock, unless he pays for it in advance, as I am
satisfied he does not wish to act out the correct principles.
He tried, the day before I left, to make me agree to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>cooperage for the last stock he got; and though he made
it answer to the whole face, two hundred, yet he did not
wish to pay me thirty in cash, and said you promised to
supply him at fifteen cents per hundred, and take it out
in cooperage; if so, your contracts must be for your own
private benefit, not mine; he has gulled me enough, and
I cannot stand his slabbering discourse any more. I am
satisfied he has no moral honesty. Our friend, the grocery-keeper,
must pay for his last, as he has bartered it
all off. I met an intimate friend of his from Burlington,
Kentucky, on Clifty, in company with our light-complexioned
friend, who lives not far in the county back of
the burgh. Two who accompany this are crossed (+)
9's, immediately from Tennessee, and have been travelling
fifteen nights. They are accompanied by a brother
from Charleston, Virginia, another from Parkersburg, Virginia,
and a third from Marietta, Ohio; all wealthy, the
bearer and all, worthy brethren. The bearer is a Grand.</p>

<h4>No. 5.</h4>

<p class="rightheader">Sugar Creek, October 24, 1825.</p>

<p><i>Esteemed Brown</i>,&mdash;After two nights' hard travelling,
I find myself well provided for, in company with our old
"Bogus Friend," who informs me he has just returned
from Toronto, Canada; and has brought some of the most
splendid bogus I ever have seen, and sells it, in trade
at 33-1/3, 28 in cash. I purchased two thousand of him,
part trade, part cash; and he is to deliver it to you. He
has sent a large quantity to Brookville, Indiana, and he
will send your two thousand from Brookville. I let him
have four horses, which I purchased from our Rising-sun
Brethren. He sent them immediately to his lawyer, in
or near Sandusky, who will forward them immediately to
Michigan. I believe the horse trade is better, and a great
deal more safe than the slave. There are many brethren
living here, and of the best order, and live up to the principles
of the Brotherhood; and of the many which live
here, and in fact all through these parts, very few are
considered other than men of the highest respectability.
But I hear many making inquiry about our Lawrenceburgh
Aurora, and Rising-sun brethren, and say the brethren
have acted in many respects badly, and our friend
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, in the burgh, who purchased the pork he shipped
from some of them; they say that he has deceived
them. I feel mortified to think he has no more principle:
I want you to call and tell him he must settle, and
I think he ought to know the same without advice. They
are the wrong men for him to try to gull; I have every
right to suspect him of dishonesty, when I think how
much the Brotherhood has done for him, you and I in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>particular, and know how he treated us; and though we
have given him all of the start he has, he would sacrifice
us both, with our families, for a hundred dollars. I have
found out that Sulivan did not make his escape, as he
assured us he did, but was sold for seven hundred and fifty
dollars. So you can depend he has swindled you and I;
do not trust him farther than you can see him, and recommend
him in the right numbers. This will be handed you
by a brother living near the islands Sixty-two and Sixty-three,
on the Mississippi; he is about to make a permanent
location, and wishes to purchase six or eight blacks.
If the lot we have an interest in have not left the burgh,
he is the man: he says there are large bands of the brethren
settled near him; I hope you can please him.</p>

<p class="rightheader">Indianopolis, November 5, 1825.</p>

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;I have been waiting four days for
your answer to mine of the 24th, and this day have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>pleasure of receiving it. I am glad to hear that your
friends in the east have not forgotten you; I had a letter
forwarded me to this place, speaking of your liberality
to the people in Pittsburg, when you visited there last
spring, and our friends &mdash;&mdash; &amp; Co., the iron traders, are
very anxious for another trade. I think they have made
better use of their trade than our two Marietta merchants
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;; the latter, I believe, some of the boys
got hold on, as he was going east, and he returned, one
thousand minus, in clear dust, and his twelve hundred in
coney. The Steubenville merchant is here, and has contracted
with me for two hundred dollars' worth of coney,
assorted; he tells me that a brother in a flat boat has
been put aside for his plunder, which, sad to relate, was
but little; and that he saw the wife of the deceased was
trying to make up the amount at this time in Cincinnati;
if she has not effected it, I think some attention had better
be given her before it is too late, as she is satisfied it
was done through mistake. You had better go or send
some one to see her; you will find her on Sixth street,
at the widow &mdash;&mdash;, or if you inquire at, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,
cabinet-maker, on Sycamore. I will give ten; you will
give the same: tell &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, on Lower Market, he must
do the same; it is a pity she should suffer through mistake.
She is a fine woman, and all of the Brotherhood
should befriend her. I hope you have, from your letter,
become satisfied with the friendship of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;. I
told you they would not do&mdash;I have known them from
boys, and the day they got that bogus from you so cheap,
I would sooner have thrown it in the river. The airs
they put on about that negro, satisfied me that they had
forfeited all principles of honesty, which is the way with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>such men after they become able to live&mdash;never think
they are beholding. I will write you again in a few days.
The bearer of this I have learned is a good brother.</p>

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;The town is full of our warm friends,
and I am happy to say that there is a fine spirit existing.
To-morrow night I will leave for Fayetteville; I have
received your package of coney, and disposed of three

Canandaigua; he is the man we sold the flour to at Buffalo.
He resides in St. Louis, Missouri, I hope he may

of mankind than any man of his age in America, and
will trade from a pin to a steamboat. He tells me he purchased
the lot of negroes which were in Madison, and he
says that he heard, since he left, that three more had been

same to Vincennes. He tells me he will be able to get
rid of every dollar at these two places, and that he can
purchase one hundred head of horses if he wished, all
which have come from other states, and some fine blooded
stock. I learn through friend &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, of Bairdstown,
Kentucky, that there has been some hard talk about
Judge &mdash;&mdash;, at Lexington. I have no confidence in a
man who drinks and gambles, as he does; I do not
care how wealthy he is, nor how great a title he
wears; for my part I intend to keep clear of him, with
all of his wealth and title; and your friend in Maysville

<h4>No. 8.</h4>

<p class="rightheader">Lexington, June 3, 1827.</p>

<p><i>Dear Brown</i>,&mdash;I have at last arrived in this wealthy
part of Kentucky, which I assure you is a treat for a man
that has been so much exposed to the fatigues of travelling
over cliffs, and swimming creeks, and all other inconveniences
that man could imagine. I arrived at Winchester,
Kentucky, where our old friend resides. It was
two o'clock when I arrived, but I found him in his shop
playing cards with a black journeyman old sledge, at
twenty-five cents a game, and you ought to have seen
him scrabble for the cards when I rapped upon the
window. I left Winchester for Maysville, where I remained
four days with our friend, the same old block of
sociability; yet he tells me he does well in the stock
trade. He says he sold forty odd horses in one year.
Since he has lived in Kentucky, over two hundred, which
you know is over fifty per year. From Maysville I
crossed the river through the Sciota region, by the way
of Portsmouth, then to Chillicothe; from there on to
Zanesville, from there to Wheeling, and then to Washington,
Pennsylvania; returned to Wheeling, then to
Parkersburgh. I did not call at Marietta; there has some
difficulty taken place in that region. From Parkersburgh
to Charleston, Kanhaway, with but little delay.
Our saline friends are great dealers in "coney." I met
twenty-six in one day at the old "Col." He is doing
his work clean, without any risk. There are, he tells
me, upon an average, five horses sold per week from
Sandy among the friends of the trade. I left Charleston;
had a tedious journey to this city. Lexington is a hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>mane
place, but dangerous to move, unless you do it
through some of the old wealthy friends of the trade. I
must now say to you that I have done well in my small
way. I have cleared over two hundred per month. I
found our friend, of the Blue Lick region, who tells me
the house trade is good along the road; that the coloured
boys do it all, and are not suspected. (<i>In speaking of
the house trade, he had reference to the entering of
houses by the slaves, pillaging, &amp;c., which would be laid
to white men.</i>) Well, now, I am through with my travels
for the present. Let me give you some little of the
history of our Dearborn brother, which I assure you is
novel. I told you he would never do, and I suppose, ere
this, you have found I was right. I cannot be fooled easy.
You thought that from the simple fact that he traded in
horses well, (<i>meaning that he stole horses well</i>,) that he
would not fail to be useful anywhere I wished to place
him; but he returned home, I suppose you discover, without
a dollar, and made sixty the first night we arrived in
Cincinnati, off of a cheese trader that slept in the adjoining
room. He wanted to return the next day to the
burgh, but I prevailed upon him to stop, as suspicion
rested not upon us. He remained according to my request,
and I never have come across such an industrious
man; but he had not much courage, less than any man
of his age I ever met, and not one particle of judgment in
human nature. When we arrived, I cautioned him about
trading with any of the brethren of the city without my
consent, knowing, as I did, the city brethren were "celish;"
however, he assured me his trade was "bogus;"
that you had supplied him with cut quarters, which no
other person dare offer, and that he had done well even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>with them. (Cut money was, at an early date, used as
change; one dollar cut in four pieces answered as twenty-five
cents each.) I found he was bent on the "bogus" trade,
and I told him to hold on a few days, and that I would
assist him to some; that I had not the first dollar, but
would find out through the brethren when I returned
from our friend's in the country&mdash;nine miles. I then left
him at the boarding-house, and promised to return the
next day. I returned according to promise; called at our
boarding-house, and upon inquiry learned he was out in
the city. I took a stroll up to our friend's, the coffee-house
keeper, in Market street. While I was passing
through the market-house, I passed by a man with a
large load upon his back. I could not discover what the
bulk was. I passed on to the coffee-house, where three
of the boys were dividing one hundred and sixty-five dollars,
the proceeds of the day's work, which, they informed
me, they had obtained from one of the soft-shell brethren.
That in the course of the day they had met a countryman,
and seeing he was apparently upon the look-out
for speculation, they had finally entered into conversation
with him, and had accidentally shown him some
bright half dollars, and told him they were counterfeit.
"What," said he, "bogus?" "Bogus, indeed," said one.
"And do you know what, bogus is?" He said he
ought to, and they then tried him, and found him one of
the right kind of brethren to skin; and that they did in
the following manner: Finding that he had money and
wanted "bogus," they set upon a plan to deceive him;
which they did by showing him the new half dollars, and
telling him they were good coin; and that if he wished
he could have them at fifteen dollars for a hundred dol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>lars
of "bogus." He agreed to purchase one hundred
and sixty-five dollars' worth, which they were to supply
that evening. That they were to meet him in the Fifth
street market-house, and deliver his bogus in a tobacco
keg headed up. He of course took it for granted that all
was honest. They separated from him, purchased a tobacco
keg, filled it with stone-coal cinders, within an inch
of the top, packing them very hard to make them weigh
heavy. They then put a false head one inch from the
top, upon which they put two hundred copper cents.
They then placed another head upon that, confining it
tight with a hoop. After preparing it, they rolled it into
the market-house where they had met. He had paid
them the one hundred and sixty-five dollars for the cinders,
which he supposed to be the most beautiful bogus,
and when he lifted the keg he was satisfied all was right;
<i>and how could he doubt it, they were brethren!</i> and
they were then dividing the spoils. I suspected, from
description, it was our Lawrenceburgh friend, but remained
silent, and returned to my room where I knew I
could ascertain. When I went, I discovered my friend
just ascending the stairs, with a large keg upon his
shoulder. "Halloo," said I, "what upon earth have you
here?" He dropped the keg, as though he had been
shot, making a crash to be heard a half mile distant, but
fortunately no person about the house appeared much
disturbed. The old lady came to the door, and wanted
to know what was the matter. I told her my friend had
fallen, but that no damage was done. She retired. As soon
as he discovered it was me, he raised his burden once
more, and carried it to the room. "Come in, sir," said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
"What have you here?" said I. "That I will show you,
in a few minutes." I knew all the time, and though I
was vexed, I could not refrain from laughter. "You
laugh," said he, "and well you might, if you knew the
speculation I had been making to-day." He soon got a
hatchet to show me his treasure. I never saw a man so
perfectly carried away at the prospect he had in store.
He was nearly exhausted by carrying such a burden so
far. The perspiration drops were oozing out of his forehead,
and he effected the opening of the keg with no little
trouble. "Now, sir," said he, "you may laugh, if you
please; raise that head and see if there is not something
in store to laugh at." I did as he bade. I lifted up the
head which covered his treasure, when to his surprise a
few black copper cents made their appearance. "Copper
bogus," said I. "I believe in my soul they have
mistaken; let's examine further." He soon discovered
the false head, which he raised, and in a double surprise
cried out, "My conscience, I won't trade. No, I will
have my money back! I will sue them." "Who will
you sue?" said I. He came to a stand, then remarked,
"Really, I can't tell who they were. They gave me no
name, but I will take them for swindling if they don't
give it up. I will swear," said he&mdash;then he paused and
I took the word from his mouth, and told him that I would
swear that he was a fool, and had better return to Dearborn
county and plough corn. He laid the coppers one
side, being about two hundred, then carefully headed
the keg up. We went to bed. During the night he
arose. I heard him going downstairs. The next morning
I discovered that both him and the keg were missing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
I never heard from him afterwards, but hope, if he is at
home, that you will hereafter keep him there.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Yours, in haste,</span></p>

<p>P.S. I hope you will answer this immediately. Direct
to Nashville, Tennessee. This Brother is a true
blue.</p>

<p><i>Friend Brown</i>,&mdash;I am happy to have the extreme
pleasure of introducing to your acquaintance one of my
most intimate friends. He visits the city on business,
which may require assistance; if so, you can confer no
greater favour on your humble servant, than by serving
him.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Yours, in haste,</span></p>

<p>The following was taken from the same sheet, having
been interlined in fine hand in sympathetic ink, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>was entirely a secret to the bearer, and read when warm,
as follows:</p>

<p><i>In a side pocket made upon the inside of an old black
velvet vest, you will find eighteen hundred dollars in
United States money. In an old hair trunk, tied
around with a rope, he carries twelve hundred dollars
in silver. He is fond of spirits, and occasionally gets
drunk, and when drunk, has no memory, and would not
acknowledge the fact of being drunk for twice the
amount. He is a man of wealth and of honour. Destroy
this immediately.</i></p>

<p>The history connected with the above letters may be
considered of great importance to explain the villanies of
this band; and from the circumstances connected with this
history, I have every reason to have full confidence that
the same letters this note refers to, were the occasion of
the bearer being robbed of some thirty-one hundred dollars.
We will now give the foundation for our belief.
During the examination of my original package of letters,
I discovered a very familiar name attached to one of those
apparent business letters, which caused me to examine
the import, and upon so doing, I found that it contained
the same which I have given, with a few omissions which
I considered of importance to my personal safety, viz.,
the names of the parties, the place of residence of the
man robbed, &amp;c. When I found that I had a familiar
name to so base an article, to satisfy myself that it was
not a forgery, I examined the same person's signatures
which had been written in the year 1827, and found they
compared satisfactorily to my mind. I then set upon a
plan to ascertain from the man who lost the money, without
his having an idea of my intention, which I did as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>follows. I wrote to a responsible man living in the same
place, to know of him if such a man of his village had
ever lost any money, and if so, what amount, the date he
lost it, &amp;c.; to which I received the following brief note:
"Sir,&mdash;You have written me upon a subject which I
was not familiar with at the time I received your letter,
but have made inquiry, and found that in the spring of
1827, the person alluded to in your letter was robbed
while in Wheeling, on his way to Philadelphia, out of
rising three thousand dollars: which money he has never
heard of. He is a man in good circumstances, and
was at that time, in fact he has always been, considered
wealthy. I conversed with him one time upon the subject,
but he dislikes to have it mentioned to him. You
likewise wished me to inquire if he received any letters
of introduction or recommendation previous to his departure,
on the date mentioned. He had several, and with one
exception, they were all from his best friends. One he
had given him by a man residing in Lawrenceburgh,
Indiana, was for the purpose of introducing him to
Daniel Brown, a merchant of Dearborn county, whom
he met in Cincinnati, on his (Brown's) return, and had
but a few moments' time to converse with him, after he
gave him the letter. You, therefore, know all I can ascertain
about your request." I could then see through the
whole lead of his misfortunes, and it is about in this way.
The letter which he bore to Brown, having the particulars
concerning his temperament, likewise the amount of
money, &amp;c., enabled Brown to set the band upon him,
who robbed him, and then divided with Brown and his
Lawrenceburgh friend. These letters I had transcribed
and put them up and lectured to the citizens of Law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>renceburgh
concerning the horrible fact of their existence;
and these are the letters spoken of, that made the
pigeon's flutter, and likewise caused so many threats
of my assassination; and all that prevented them was, that
they feared whoever might have the handling of the
papers hereafter might handle them with less mercy.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>I have frequently, in the course of this work, had to
notice the very intimate connection which those concerned
in the administration of justice, or ostensibly in
the suppression of crime, had with those who perpetrate
it. In all of our large cities, this occasionally forces
itself into public notice. Anxious as the authorities always
are to conceal any thing of this kind, it accidentally
leaks out. The opportunity for concealment, and the
advantages afforded by official station, have not been overlooked
by the Brothers, and the police of every city contains
several of the fraternity. In all fairness, however,
the great mass of crime connected with such establishments
ought not to be laid to their charge. The very
wish to be connected with the police, indicates a morbid
disposition of the mind&mdash;a desire to be familiar with
crime; for it is necessary to detect it successfully, to come
in contact frequently with the criminal. In consequence,
by familiarity, crime loses its enormity: the police officer
sees how seldom the perpetrator is detected; how often,
when detected, he escapes unwhipped of justice; he
connives at some petty offence, in the hope of entrapping
the criminal in some more flagrant act, and tampers with
crime, till the little moral sensibility he had when he entered
the service is destroyed. This is obviously a true
picture of human nature; but I must proceed with the
story, which suggested these remarks.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>In no city of the Union has the depredations of the
Band of Brothers been more extensive than in Cincinnati,
Ohio, yet there seems to be a prevailing wish, entertained
even by those who have witnessed their ravages,
to doubt the existence of any such organization. Nor am
I surprised at this incredulity&mdash;the thought that we are
surrounded by hundreds of individuals, sworn to protect
and assist one another in their ravages upon our lives and
property, is no very pleasant prospect for contemplation.
Sincerely I wish it were merely a dream of the night,
but the unaccountable and sudden downfall of some of
the most respectable and talented families of that city
convince that it yet exists in all its awful realities. In
confirmation of this I will introduce the history of one
family, guarding myself as much as possible from saying
any thing that might hurt the feelings of any of the relatives
yet living. It consisted of five boys&mdash;at least that
number is all that has come under my notice; the eldest,
at the age of sixteen, connected himself with bad associates,
was committed to the jail on a charge of theft, and
convicted. In a short time the next brother followed in
the same course, and shared the same fate. The remaining
children were yet young, and to preserve them from
the vicious habits of the elder ones, the father kept them
at hard labour every day. We are not intimately acquainted
with the character of the father, but we never
heard any thing laid to his charge but that he was a dissipated,
and so far an immoral man. He at least gave
his children an example of industry, and could not be
suspected of training them in dishonest practices. The
eldest son was pardoned, or served his time out, we forget
which, and came home to his father's house; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>was soon taken in another misdemeanour, and sentenced
to ten years' confinement in the Kentucky State Prison.
At the expiration of his term the second also returned,
but fearfully depraved and abandoned. He seemed to
take a delight in all manner of wickedness, and bore evidence
that he came from a good school. After a few
months of dissipation, supported by robbery, he was
again taken, convicted the second time, and sent to the
State Prison. From it he made his escape, and found
his way to Vicksburg, but on attempting a robbery, he
was detected, and shot through his left shoulder, the ball
fracturing the bone very badly. One day while he
was under arrest, several men visited him; he was
alarmed when they first entered, but soon regained his
self-possession. One of the party inquired why he
seemed so much affrighted at their entrance; to which
he replied, that at first sight he had taken one of them
for a man of the name of Phelps. [A robber who was
afterwards taken, and attempted to break from jail, but
was shot down in the streets of Vicksburg. For particulars
see "Gambling Unmasked."] A very friendly
feeling was soon established between the robber and his
visitors; in a few days he was taken from jail, and
bent his way for New Orleans, where he was again detected
in the very act of robbery, but in attempting to
make his escape was shot down by the captain of the
guard.</p>

<p>This same year of his death the third brother got into
difficulty, and was sentenced to the Penitentiary for three
years. Before the expiration of his sentence, the fourth
was convicted. The fifth boy at this time was about
seventeen, and he too was caught stealing, convicted, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>received his sentence about the time the fourth regained
his liberty.</p>

<p>The third brother, after serving the specified period in
what is called the <i>Penitentiary</i>, took his way south,
where he was again committed for robbery, and sentenced
to five years' confinement in the Louisiana State
Prison. At the expiration of that period he started for
home, but when near the island of Sixty-six, on the
Mississippi, he concluded to take a trunk and jump overboard.
This feat he accomplished successfully; but
unluckily for him, it was in the same year in which so
many outlaws were put to death by the citizens, and having
connected himself with a band who were at that time
flooding the river with counterfeit coin, negro-stealing,
and indulging in all manner of villany, he was taken by
a company, and with about forty others put to death,
some being shot, and others tied up in sacks and thrown
into the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The fifth brother was now in the Ohio Penitentiary,
the fourth in the Indiana State Prison, but the eldest
brother was released from confinement, and returned to
Cincinnati. His long confinement, however, seems to
have had no very beneficial effect, for in a few months he
was again convicted of petit larceny, and sentenced to
serve in the chain gang. Here he conducted himself so
well as to gain the unqualified commendation of one of
the drivers, who in consequence treated him indulgently.
About this period, there was much excitement, caused by
the frequency of night robberies, and no trace of the
thieves could be found, by which they could be detected.
The most vigilant means were used, and many
were sent to the jails and penitentiary, but still the rob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>beries
went on. Among those committed at this period,
was the fifth brother, who for a short period had enjoyed
his liberty. The eldest brother served out his time in
the chain gang, and after being liberated, suddenly disappeared;
and, which surprised many, the driver of the
chain gang disappeared at the same time. A day or two
after their disappearance, a drover from Kentucky, who
had been at Cincinnati, and was on his way home, was
taken from his horse, robbed, his throat cut, and left for
dead upon the road side. They had, however, merely
severed the windpipe, and on being discovered, he was able
to give such information as led to the detection of the
driver and his friend, the convict. They were arrested,
and identified by the mangled drover; and the citizens,
knowing the desperate character of the elder brother,
who had served an apprenticeship in their own State
Prison, gave them a trial according to "Lynch" custom,
and hung them both. Thus ended the life of the eldest
of the brothers&mdash;the third who had suffered the penalty
of death for their crimes.</p>

<p>The suspicions of the people were excited by this occurrence,
and a train of investigation set on foot which
left no doubt but that the recent robberies were committed
by the chain driver and his gang. At night they
were freed from their chains, allowed to prowl about and
plunder, and brought their spoils to the prison, where it
could easily be stowed away without suspicion. We believe
that we are quite within the mark, if we attribute
one-eighth of the robberies committed in large cities, to
the police, or perpetrated with their connivance. Many,
we hesitate not to say, are done by men whom the public
believe to be in prison. It has become a proverb, "Set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>a thief to catch a thief," and the public seem to have
acquiesced that thus it shall ever be. There is an allowed
and constant connection between the criminal and the
officer engaged in suppressing crime, but whether it be
necessary and unavoidable, or the best disposition possible,
deserves some consideration. The hangman is in
general only a little more fortunate than his culprit. The
leader of a band of Regulators is commonly more ferocious,
and as lawless as the victim against whom his fury
is directed. The lawyer unscrupulously pockets a fee,
which he knows has been obtained by the plunder of the
citizen. Not a few of them hang about our jails, prying
into the means of the prisoners, and divide with them
the spoil, sheltering themselves from communicating any
disclosures they make under their judicial privileges.
But if justice be the end of the law, why should the
communications of a prisoner to his counsel be held
sacred? If the case be undefensible otherwise, why
should it be defended, unless it be to give a fee to the
lawyer, at the expense of justice? With all deference to
the legislators of our country, and to the gentlemen of
the legal profession, this seems a privilege not to be
envied: to <i>know</i> that you are assisting to defraud, but
debarred by custom from disclosing it; to know that the
culprit is guilty, and deserves punishment or restraint,
but to send him forth again upon society to commit further
crime.</p>

<p>Our readers may be anxious to know what became of
the other two brothers, the fourth and fifth. At this moment
we believe they are both in the State Prison.
Now how was the ruin of this once respectable family
accomplished? Why did the fate of the elder not deter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>the younger from crime? Were they merely drawn
along by the contagion of ill-example, or were there more
potent influences at work in their destruction? And why
did punishment and penitentiaries do so little in their reformation?
The greater part of their lives were passed
within their walls, cut off from the influence of evil, but
we see no sanitory effect. We will not answer these
questions directly, but in the course of this work will
supply the reader with materials to answer them for
himself. We have every reason to believe that the eldest
and the second were entangled in the meshes of The
Secret Band of Brothers, in a manner from which there
was no escape. They are ever on the look-out for any
individual who has forfeited his character, and who promises
by his ingenuity or dexterity to be a fit tool for
their purposes. Their agents are to be found in all the
professions, in the magistracy, and in the prisons and
penitentiaries; sometimes, under the vail of hypocrisy,
assuming a fair exterior at the time they are engaged in
all manner of villany; at other times, when their influence
in any place is in the ascendency, openly showing
their real character. Men can be found in many of our
towns so notoriously profligate, that not one individual in
the place could be found that would say they were honest
men, yet through solicitation, party spirit, and sometimes
through fear, they are elected to official stations. It is
one of the leading objects of the Secret Band, to have
as many of the brotherhood in the magistracy as possible,
and neither money nor importunity are spared to effect
their object. They know what they are about: they are
too sagacious to suppose that a thief will catch a thief;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>that a gambler will suppress gambling, or a drunkard
promote temperance; and it would be well that those who
really desire any of these objects, were equally "wise in
their generation."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>The spring of 1833 found me travelling through the
Choctaw nation, which, at that time, with the exception
of the government posts, was a wilderness. Fort Towson,
Duxborough, Jonesborough, Lost Prairie, Horse
Prairie, Pecan Point, and several other places throughout
this wild and newly settled country, were crowded with
every kind and description of people from the states, from,
the government agents and contractors to the wild and
mysterious refugee&mdash;the latter being very numerous, and
having settled upon the south side of Red river, to evade
the pursuit of the United States' officer of justice, that
portion then being considered within the boundaries of
Texas. The whole region was one of peculiar debasement
in all respects. As might be suspected, seasoned
as it was with such a population, drunkenness, debauchery,
and murder walked abroad, hand in hand, day
and night. Human life was valued no higher than the
life of an ox or a hog, and the heart of the settlement
was cold, and palsied to the most remote touch of feeling,
and hardened to the recital of brutalities and crimes of
the most indescribable enormity. Men talked of their
evil doings, their deep, revolting guilt, with the most impudent
freedom, and laughed and chuckled over them as
though they were the best jokes in the world!</p>

<p>It was in one of the Texan settlements, in this rude,
wicked tract of country, that an incident came to my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>knowledge, quite by accident, which I will relate. The
settlement contained some seventy to eighty people, men,
women, and children, white and black. I was taking a
stroll with one of the settlers among the cabins and huts,
he being familiar with the occupants of each, their habits
and history. When we passed a spot worth notice, he
gave me the character of the owner, his wealth, &amp;c., and
although all about the settlement wore an appearance of
the most abject poverty, I was surprised to find the wealth
which many of the inhabitants of so desolate, dreary, and
forbidding a place possessed. We finally came to a small
log cabin, at the extreme end of the settlement, apparently
about twenty feet in length by eighteen deep, a
story and a half high.</p>

<p>"Who lives here?" said I.</p>

<p>"The widow &mdash;&mdash;," replied my guide, whose name
was Edmonds&mdash;"the widow of &mdash;&mdash;, but&mdash;yes&mdash;the widow
of Dr &mdash;&mdash;, who was killed a few days ago."</p>

<p>I was struck with my companion's pauses, and thought
there was something singular in them, especially as his
countenance at the time seemed to change slightly. I
soon mustered resolution to ask him who were the murderers
of Doctor &mdash;&mdash;, but his reply was simply that
he did not know.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the widow," said I; "will you
introduce me?"</p>

<p>He declined, stating that he must then leave me, and
go along some half a mile further, where some men were
at work, chopping down a bee-tree.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I; "I will step in and introduce
myself. You have awakened some little curiosity in my
mind to know more about the murder of this man."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>He left me without making any reply, and I entered
the cabin, the door of which was standing ajar. I found,
seated near the fire on a rude bench, a female, perhaps
thirty years old, whose countenance wore a look of deep
dejection, but at the same time betrayed strong evidence
of having been once quite attractive. A little girl sat in
her lap&mdash;two boys of the ages of perhaps seven and
eleven occupied a bench at her right&mdash;an infant of, I
should think, three months old, slept in the cradle, which
a little girl apparently about five years old stood rocking.
The group was a very imposing one. As I entered,
I gave a tap upon the door, which caused the mother to
turn towards me; but she did not speak, waiting, it would
seem, for me to introduce my business. I apologized for
my unceremonious entrance, saying, that I had learned
she was formerly a resident in the states; and that I
being also from thence, felt some interest in her and her
family. She beckoned me to a seat, and after some time,
told me she was born in Philadelphia, but that, having
married a Kentuckian, she moved there, and lived some
eight or nine years in that state&mdash;that her husband, at the
expiration of that time, had taken his family to Little
Rock, Arkansas, where they resided one year, and that
from thence they had come to the place where I found
them.</p>

<p>Here there was a pause; in fact, I discovered that the
poor woman's voice faltered the moment she approached
the subject of her arrival at her present residence. The
silence was broken by the child, who stood rocking the
cradle, and who said, "This is a bad place, ain't it, Ma?
Here the bad men live that killed Pa." At this the mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ther
burst into tears. As she did so, she kindly told the
child to hush.</p>

<p>After the mother's tears had partially subsided, I told
her to talk to me without restraint; that I had visited the
settlement on the other side of the river on government
business, which I expected to transact, and leave in a
very few days. I here was guilty of falsehood. I had
not visited the settlement for government, of course, but
to pursue my iniquitous course of gambling with the
refugees.</p>

<p>The woman implored me to be watchful; that I was
in the midst of the most abandoned description of men
that could possibly be conceived of; and that they would
make a victim of me the more readily, on account of my
extreme youth. I told her that they could want nothing
of me, for the simple reason that I had nothing valuable
about me. She assured me that it was not always avarice
which tempted these men to deeds of blood. They
had butchered her poor husband in the very house where
we were, within hearing of herself and children, and
when all were imploring that his life might be spared.
And yet money was not the temptation. She then gave
me a history of the cruel murder of her husband, which
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Doctor &mdash;&mdash; was educated a physician in the city of
Philadelphia, though a native of Kentucky. He married
his wife in that city; after which he went back to Kentucky,
where he settled down in the practice of his profession.
It was not many years after he took up his
abode in his native place before he became involved, and
subsequently being accused of committing a forgery, he
concluded it was best to leave his native state. His first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>stopping-place, after leaving Kentucky, was Little Rock,
Arkansas, where he remained until his brother-in-law
joined him with his family. Becoming uneasy and unhappy
there, he finally removed to the settlement, where
an end was put to his earthly career by the band of assassins.</p>

<p>His wife, when she came to this portion of her husband's
career, was again deeply affected; but she soon
mustered composure enough to continue the story.</p>

<p>After my husband came here, he proceeded to build
this house, and we all moved into it in a very short period
after the first log was laid. He was a changed man,
and my health had become impaired by the exposures
which it was necessary to encounter, in travelling through
this wilderness. Doctor &mdash;&mdash; was a changed man;
most painfully was this the case. He was not only
moody and sullen in his temperament, and at times unhappy
to the last degree; but he did not seem to take
that pleasure which he once did in the society of his wife
and children. Now and then he would drink hard, and
become intoxicated, in which case he abused me most
shamefully, and I bore all for the sake of the children.
Some few days before his death, he entered into a speculation
with some bad fellows here, to smuggle spirits
through the nation, which they succeeded in doing, and
with great profit. About this time, or just after, when
in a calm and subdued mood, he confessed to me, that he
was not an honest man; that he was a refugee from justice,
and a doomed man; that a trap had been laid for
him a short time after he was married; that he fell into
it; that he was a sworn member of a band of desperadoes
and villains, and that he was doomed to be a guilty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>wretch so long as he lived. I thought he was crazy, but
his assurance was in a few days fully verified.</p>

<p>Not long after my husband made this confession to me,
he ran a partition across the cabin&mdash;making two rooms.
In the other department he put two beds, and whenever
any of his cronies called to see him, he would order myself
and the children into the room. Here we remained
while he and his companions drank and played cards&mdash;making
sometimes such a noise that it seemed as if the
very roof would be raised. They often kept it up all
night long.</p>

<p>One morning, after one of these frolics, he said to me
he wished I was at home with my father; that he never
intended to return to Philadelphia himself; but he would
see that I was safely taken there. I asked why he was
so much inclined to part from me. He stated that that
was his business; I must leave him. Only the night
before, he had been accused of divulging secrets to me
in regard to his companions; that he had promised them
to send me home. He added, that I might take all the
children but the two eldest boys. I protested against
separating me and my children. His only reply was,
that his determination on the point was fixed.</p>

<p>That night he ordered myself and the children into the
room, in a more angry tone than ever, and barred us in.
It was not long after this before his wicked companions
arrived and planted themselves down at the table. I listened
at the door, and while my husband had gone out
of the cabin for some purpose, I heard them whispering
busily together. As he entered the apartment, however,
the whispering ceased, and one of them said, "Let's play
for the liquor first, and decide that point afterwards."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>After this, they played and swore, and one would have
supposed the room to have been occupied by fiends incarnate
rather than by men. At about twelve o'clock, one
of the company said, "Well, boys, now is the time; what
are we here for?" "Out with the light," said another.
My husband now asked what they proposed doing, when,
without giving him the slightest notice, the light was put
out, and a heavy blow descended. I heard my husband cry
out, "Do not murder me;" but the strokes fell heavy and
fast, and spite of my screams and the screams of my children&mdash;spite
of our efforts to beat the door in, the bloody work
was kept up until I heard my husband's body fall upon the
floor. In a short time his murderers left. I tried to burst
the door open, but without success. At last, I raised my
eldest boy to the window, and he crawled outside, and
ran round, entering the door which led to the room containing
his father's corpse. As the child moved towards
the door of the room, for the purpose of unbarring it, he
fell over the dead body of his father. The door was
finally unbarred, and I rushed into the room where my
murdered husband lay. Oh, sir, I cannot tell you what
were then my feelings. The lights which the children
brought into the room exposed the whole scene, and it
was one which I could not describe if I would&mdash;my husband's
body lying upon the floor, weltering in blood. I
tried to lift it up to the bed, but could not. I then, with the
assistance of the children, rolled it up in a counterpane,
and we sat down and watched it till morning&mdash;fearing
that, if we did not, it might be carried off by wolves&mdash;a
large number of which howled about the house until day
dawned. Oh, sir, it was a sorrowful night! The next
morning several of the neighbours called in, and after ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>pressing
their horror at the deed of blood, assured me
that they would aid in bringing the murderers to justice.
That they knew them, and that they resided on the Sabine
river. Would you believe it, sir? Two of the
very sympathizers I knew to have been concerned in the
murder of my husband.</p>

<p>A coffin was made, into which my poor husband's
body was laid, and then the neighbours buried him, but
in such a manner that he lay but a foot or two below the
earth's surface. I have been afraid the beasts of prey
which infest this region would get possession of his
corpse; so, with my children, I build every night a fire
near his grave.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," added the woman, "I have told you the
painful story, and you will see in what a dreadful situation
I am. I am here in this dreadful place, with perhaps
one hundred dollars in money, and five children,
nearly all of whom constantly require my watchful care.
Can you not assist me in my wretchedness?"</p>

<p>I told the poor thing I would endeavour to do something
for her. I had hardly done so, when Edmonds
passed the door of the cabin on his way back from the
choppers. Seeing me, he turned back and said, as I
passed out to meet him, "Well, Green, what do you think
of the widow?" My reply was, that she was so shy and
distant that I could not learn much about her, one way
or the other; that she appeared unwilling, or afraid to
converse.</p>

<p>"It is well enough that she did," was Edmond's reply,
"she does not know what she talks about. When she
does choose to speak, I believe her to be either crazy or
foolish, and d&mdash;n me if I know which."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmonds invited me to go with him to his home. So
I went along. I found there a man, named Scoggins,
with whom Edmonds got into a very free conversation.
I heard him say, "We must send that woman away; she
talks to somebody every day; she must be taken care of
in one way or the other. She must, Scoggins, she must."</p>

<p>It was not long after this, before Scoggins took me
aside, and in a friendly manner advised me not to go to
the widow's again; that she was a bad and a meddlesome
person withal. I did not visit her afterwards;
indeed, I had no opportunity to do so, for the day following
the incidents I here related, in company with Edmonds
and Scoggins, I left the settlement for Fort Towson&mdash;about
one hundred and fifty miles east. Our object
was to play cards with the officers at the fort, and lighten
them of some of their change. We also expected to fall
in with some of the half-bred Choctaws, who are not inexpert
in the shuffle. Edmonds and Scoggins were ordinary
players, and depended on my skill. The former
was a shrewd fellow, a Georgian by birth&mdash;aged about
forty-five; the latter, a Canadian, was about the same
age. They had served together during the war of 1812,
and in the same company. Two more peculiar men
could not be found. Like a pair of well-trained horses,
I saw very soon, after we joined company, they pulled
together. They had a negro with them, who was deaf
and dumb; and he was one of the best servants I ever
saw. He had been Edmonds' attendant for fifteen years,
and was, I should think, about fifty years old. This old
negro knew every route from Canada to Texas. He
would stand and sleep, like a horse, for hours, and seemed
to care much more for horses than he did for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>self.
I thought there was something more than at first
appeared about the old darkey. While at the fort, he
would, in our company, stand for hours, it seemed to
me listening attentively to all that was said, and appearing
to understand it. He was very submissive and
polite to any one who noticed him, and, from the beginning,
appeared to take a wonderful liking to me. At
Fort Towson I tried to get rid of Edmonds and Scoggins,
telling them I had resolved to leave them, and that I was
going to cross the Nation to Fort Smith, about one hundred
and fifty miles distant. They appeared to like the
route I had chosen, and said they would accompany me.
While at Fort Towson, I discovered that both of my companions
had a large number of acquaintances there, mixed
in among the Indians; and, likewise, that many of the
slaves appeared to know them.</p>

<p>We finally left the fort, in company with ten Choctaws.
I had purchased, while in the nation, twelve head of
horses, two of which were quarter horses, that is, intended
to run a quarter of a mile in singularly quick time.
I obtained them of a half-bred Choctaw, and they were
valued at five hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>We encamped, the first night after our departure, about
thirty miles distant from Fort Towson. The next morning
I found that my two valuable quarter horses, with six
others of the drove, were missing. I said something about
my chance of finding them again, but soon had every
hope of the kind destroyed, by being informed that the
Pawnee Indians were very numerous in the neighbourhood;
that they were great horse thieves; and had undoubtedly
appropriated to themselves my valuable beasts.
We went fifty miles further, when we again encamped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Here the horses of the dumb negro and Scoggins were
missing. They appeared to think their animals might
be recovered, and turned back for that purpose, promising
to overtake us, if possible, at Fort Smith.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the fort, I disposed of the horses
I had left, and took passage on the steamboat Reindeer,
for the mouth of White River. Edmonds insisted on
accompanying me. I made no objection, of course, but
was anxious to get rid of him. It was about the twentieth
of May, when we arrived at Montgomery's Point, on
the Mississippi. Edmonds, daring the passage, frequently
sympathized with me on the loss of my horses. He also,
now and then, spoke to me about the widow of Doctor
&mdash;&mdash;, commiserated her forlorn situation, and stated
that he had a strong desire, and in fact determination, to
communicate intelligence of her deplorable condition to
her friends in Philadelphia. He asked me, if I did not,
myself, think of doing something of the kind. I told
him that I had forgotten her name, and had I remembered
it, I hardly thought that I should trouble myself about
her or her affairs. He said, he, too, had forgotten the
name, but he could procure it of Scoggins when he returned.</p>

<p>We remained at the Point several days, awaiting the
arrival of a steamboat. Finally, the Chester came along,
bound for St. Louis. I took passage in her, and left Edmonds
behind, not a little to my gratification. We had
not proceeded far from the Point, when the Chester broke
down, and I was obliged to get on board of a down boat,
and return to the Point. On arriving there, the first person
I encountered was the dumb negro, who told me that Ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>monds
had died suddenly, since my departure, of the cholera,
which was raging at that time on the Mississippi, and
which cut men down almost without warning. On inquiry,
I found the negro had told me the truth, and must confess
I was not a little astonished at it. But a few hours previously,
I had left Edmonds, apparently well; now he
was a corpse! The thought gave me a shade of melancholy,
especially as I knew and felt that he had been cut
down in guilt; for that he was both a robber and a murderer
I could not for a moment doubt.</p>

<p>I made some inquiry about the amount of money left
by Edmonds, and discovered that after paying all the
expenses of his funeral, the amount of nine hundred dollars
would be left, which, according to his request just
before his death, was to be sent to his friends in Savanna,
Georgia.</p>

<p>Not long after I got back to the Point, when walking
out alone, the dumb negro joined me, and motioned
me to follow him: I did so, without hesitation. We had
not gone far out of the way, before he placed himself near
me, and, to my surprise, spoke to me as plainly and distinctly
as any one could. He said he knew he would
surprise me when he talked like other folks; but he
would give me a good reason for having seemed to be
dumb. He then gave me a sketch of his chequered
career. He was once a slave, but had been a free man
between thirty and forty years. At the age of twenty,
he was purchased from his master, at Petersburg, Virginia,
to save his life, by a band of outlaws of which he
became a member, in a servile capacity. These men
had freed him, soon after they purchased him from his
master, and in consideration he had taken the oath as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>one of their gang, and had sworn, with other things, to
appear to be deaf and dumb, so long as he should live&mdash;the
penalty for any forgetfulness, or otherwise, that
should betray that he could either speak or hear, being
death! That he had been educated to this end; that
the band had men who could converse with him readily
by signs, and that he had been so much accustomed to
communicate his thoughts in that manner, that it had become
second nature. He told me he was now determined
to go to Canada, where he proposed remaining for
the balance of his life. I asked him how he meant to go?
His reply was, that he should make the journey by land;
that he knew every foot of the route, and had hundreds
of warm friends all the way along. He further said that
he could communicate to me a secret, which he thought
it would be better for me to keep&mdash;and this is the first
time I have ever publicly revealed it.</p>

<p>The secret was, that he and Scoggins, after leaving
Edmonds and myself, had retraced their steps to the skirts
of Texas; that my horses had not been taken, as I supposed,
by the Indians, but that hired tools of Edmonds and
Scoggins had stolen them. That it was well for me I laid
my money out in horses: had I not done so, they would
have murdered me, to possess themselves of it. He further
assured me, that I had been for three months in the
most heartless and desperate region which the country
affords, and among my worst enemies. The negro added,
that he had heard hard letters read concerning me since
I was in the country. That they were written a year
before, by certain men belonging to the same band, whom
I knew, but least suspected. One of them lived near
Lawrenceburgh, Indiana; another was Goodrich, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>notorious villain to whom I have alluded in the preceding
part of the work.</p>

<p>This negro also told me that Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, who had been
murdered on the Texan frontier, was himself a member
of the Secret Band, and that he was killed to save many
a better man. That he and Scoggins had gone back to
see that the widow and her family were removed; but
they found, on reaching the settlement, she had left. We
had learned, moreover, that when seventy or eighty miles
on her journey to her friends', she was taken sick and died,
and that she had lost her youngest child before she left the
settlement. It was further stated that the remainder of
her family were at Little Rock, with a friend of her husband's,
who would provide for them till her family could
either send for them, or give some directions in regard to
their disposition.</p>

<p>The negro advised me never to divulge my opinions
in relation to the doctor's death, nor to the history of his
family out west. I told him I did not recollect their
names, and therefore could not do so if I would. He
assured me that it was well for me, perhaps, that it was
so; and that it could do me no good if I did. I spoke to
the negro about the lively sympathy which Edmonds had
expressed for the family, a few days before I parted with
him; that he had told me, in case he could procure the
name and residence of their friends at the east, he would
write them; and that he had asked me if I remembered
them. I told him I did not.</p>

<p>The negro assured me that it was well for me I had
been so ignorant on the subject; Edmonds was only trying
me. Had I appeared to have known any thing, and
betrayed any disposition to give publicity to what I knew,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>he would have prevented me, even if he had taken my
life.</p>

<p>I discovered from the negro, that the secret band of outlaws,
to whom I here alluded, had a large number of
members scattered among the different tribes of Indians;
that they are all about the western country, in fact, and
that all are true to each other as steel itself. The negro
assured me that he could find friends at every turn; yes,
those who <i>would die for him!</i> He was well off, however,
without them, and had determined to pass the remainder
of his days in living a life of honesty; hoping
that, by so doing, God would forgive him, if man did not.</p>

<p>The negro told me much more in regard to himself and
his companions. He said he had been deaf and dumb,
in order to find out what was going on. He stood about
and heard much said, which would not have been said
had it been supposed he could hear, and much, too, that
was at times extremely valuable to the band.</p>

<p>I told him that I had often noticed and pitied him.
His reply was, that he saw I felt for him, and it was
none the worse for me that I did. This very county
where we were, was afterwards infested by Murrill and
his gang; and it was here that, in 1841, the citizens
turned out and put to death, by shooting and drowning,
some forty or fifty villains.</p>

<p>But to return to the negro. I told him that his intelligence
startled me. He assured me, that while with him
I was not in danger; that, to tell the truth, where we
then were was not a very bad tract of country. For,
said he, the brethren of Arkansas and Mississippi are not
"clear grit." That a few weeks preceding, a man by
the name of Jeffries, who had passed counterfeit money,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>they permitted to be taken and put to death. He had,
it seems, got off about one thousand dollars of the spurious
money on some river boatmen and traders; who returned
when they found the money was bad, pursued the
counterfeiter to an island on the river; where, after having
stripped him naked and tied him to a tree, they beat him
to death! It was true this man was not a member of the
secret fraternity; but he would have been had his life
been spared.</p>

<p>At this point of my conversation with the negro, I discovered
the steamboat HURON near by, so I shook hands
with him and left him. Rejoicing that a boat had at
last come along, I was soon on board her, bound for Louisville.
We "wooded" some thirty miles distant from
Montgomery's Point, and at the wood-yard, I overheard
one of the workmen telling about the skeleton of a man
which had been found on an island near by; that it was
tied to a tree, and that it was the remains of a man
who had been whipped to death for passing counterfeit
money. The woodman added, that the poor victim's
watch and clothes were found hanging near his skeleton.
This story confirmed the statement of the dumb negro
on this point, and gave me confidence in all he had told
me.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p class="rightheader">State Prison, Auburn, April 7, 1845.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Tribune:</i></p>

<p>We have had a recent visit from Mr. J. H. Green, the
"Reformed Gambler," of whom you have previously
spoken favourably in the editorial department of your
paper. Many are highly pleased with the man, and
think he should be sustained by public patronage and the
press, inasmuch as he comes with good credentials of
moral and Christian character from the church. Many
think his course calculated to do much good, for this and
coming generations. He appears admirably calculated
and accomplished for exposing the deceptive marks and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tricks of this heartless race of land-pirates, called Gamblers,
alias "<i>Sportsmen</i>." His description of their infernal
conduct and character cannot fail to put men on
their guard in season to shun them as they would a deadly
pestilence that walketh in darkness, and destruction that
wasteth at noonday.</p>

<p>The grog-shop, the brothel, and the gambling-room, are
three of the blackest fountains of human misery over
which the devil presides. From these he gathers the
bitterest waters of hellish destruction, and spreads them
broad-cast over creation: of which eternity can only measure
the full amount.</p>

<p>The Temperance Cause has attacked one of those sinks
of Satan; the Moral Reform enterprise has commenced
upon another, and Mr. Green has now taken the third
"bull by the horns." Money and talent, and the press,
are enlisted against the two former, and shall we stand
aloof, and leave Mr. Green to combat the dragon single-handed
and alone? It is high time the whole community
was aroused to the desolating evils of Gambling;
and the press, too, in thunder-tones, should be made to
speak out upon this, as upon other soul-destroying vices
of the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Green has given five Lectures in our village: two
in the Town Hall, two in the Methodist Church, and one
in the State Prison. On Sabbath, sixth instant, at four
o'clock, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, he addressed the children of the several
Sabbath-schools of the town, in the Methodist Episcopal
Church, to good effect; and in the evening, the same
house was filled to a perfect jam. Here Mr. Green was
listened to with the best possible attention; and I believe
the great bulk of that immense throng, not only believed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>him a reformed man, but also that he was doing a good
and necessary work in this country.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, Sabbath morning, Mr. Green spoke to
the unfortunate inmates of this prison, numbering some
eight hundred convicts, besides a large concourse of citizens,
who flocked to hear him at the same place. His
discourse was listened to in breathless silence by those
men, and hundreds of them wept freely, while listening
to a recital of the horrors of Gambling, as experienced
during twelve wretched years of his own gambling life,
and of his reformation and salvation by grace in Christ.
A deep and powerful impression pervaded the vast concourse,
while all was graced by beautiful strains of vocal
music by the "Boston Quartet Club," and all passed off
finely.</p>

<p>After Chapel service, Mr. Green and myself visited
the cell of Henry Wyatt, the murderer of James Gordon,
of which the papers have spoken. They readily recognised
each other, as having been members of the same
gambling fraternity in the south and west. More than
fifty gamblers were named by them, whose doleful history
was equally familiar to both.</p>

<p>Previous to this visit by Mr. Green, Wyatt had told
me that gambling was the cause of his ruin. At the
close of our visit of some two hours, Mr. Green gave
Wyatt a pathetic exhortation to read his Bible, and pray
much, to repent of sin, and believe in Christ, and to seek
religion as the only thing which could prepare him for
his approaching doom. Tears flowed freely, and Wyatt
exclaimed, "What a pity it is that you had not come out
in this way four years ago; then I should not have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>here in <i>chains</i>, as you see me now." We wept together,
and left his cell in silence.</p>

<p class="center">GREEN'S FIRST VISIT TO AUBURN STATE PRISON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Bond</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;I shall be happy to contribute to your valuable
sheet the following communication:</p>

<p>I visited the Auburn State Prison, upon the morning of
the 4th instant, accompanied by the Boston Quartet Club,
better known in New York city than in this region for
their valuable services in calling out so many thousands
to hear the eloquence of John B. Gough, in behalf of temperance.
We passed through the different workshops
of the prison, where many hundreds are doing the different
labours allotted to them by their agents. The health
of the prisoners is as good, and spirits better than any
institution I have ever visited. Though the gloom of the
prisoner was not made manifest by his haggard countenance,
yet I could not prevent the melancholy reflection,
that every heart knew its own sorrow. I have seen much
of human depravity in this wicked world&mdash;I have felt the
sensitive nerve made like an ice-drop by the cold finger
of scorn&mdash;I know how to sympathize with the child of
circumstances&mdash;with the heart-broken parent, whose pale,
care-worn cheek but too plainly speaks, "We feel trouble,
but ye know it not." How many friends and relatives
are now bemoaning the loss of that boy who was once the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>pride of all that knew him in the days of his affluence!
Rising eight hundred souls are now confined in the Auburn
State Prison; and as my thoughts expanded in their
melancholy train, I asked myself, Who are to blame for
all the crimes committed, and which have incarcerated
so many human beings? I answered by referring to my
own sad experience. By the carelessness of the parent
or guardian, the bud is nipped before the blossom puts
forth, and should it not scatter its leaves to the four winds,
it cannot fail to produce evil fruit. With these sad feelings,
I wended my way through the prison, which speaks
well to the praise of the different agents placed there to
conduct the working departments.</p>

<p>On my return to the prison office, I was introduced to
the chaplain, Rev. O.E. Morrill, which reverend gentleman
informed me that a man by the name of Wyatt, then
confined in one of the cells for the murder of Gordon, on
the 16th of March, in the Auburn State Prison, had confessed
to him that he had lived a gambler several years
in the south and west, and he would like I should call
upon him. I accompanied him to the cell of the murderer.
The door was thrown open upon its grating
hinges, when the reverend gentleman introduced me as an
acquaintance of his who had travelled south several years,
and thought that he (Wyatt) would be glad to converse
with him. He said he was happy to see me, and asked
me to be seated. After a short discourse, relative to the
different classes of men then in confinement, I asked him
what he followed in his travels through the south. He
told me gambling. I asked him how long he had been
engaged in that nefarious business. He said twelve or
thirteen years. I asked him if he knew many gamblers?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
He said he did. I asked him if he ever knew one by
the name of Green? He said he did. I asked his name?
He answered, "John;" said he knew him in 1832, 1833,
1834, and 1835, and saw him in 1842 in St. Louis. I
asked him if he was intimate with Green? He said he
knew him as one gambler knew another. I asked if I
favoured him? He said if I would stand in the light he
would tell me. I did so. He said I looked like the man.
I told him I was the man, but that I never knew him by
the name of Wyatt. He said I did not; that Wyatt was
not his real name. He then told me another, which was
not his real name, and asked me if I did not hear of a
man being murdered near St. Louis in the year 1841,
and of two men being arrested, both tried and convicted,
one having a new trial granted him, the other being hung.
I told him that I thought I had. He said he was the
man that had the new trial granted, and was acquitted;
"and," said he, "they hung the wrong man; he was
innocent; I am the guilty man; but they hung him and
cleared me." "But," says I, "you were under a different
name still, at that time." He said, "Yes, by none
of those names do you know me, but my real name you
are familiar with. Your name," said he, "I knew in
the year 1832; the gamblers called you John, but Jonathan
is your real name." My curiosity was highly excited
at the strange management of the murderer. But
you may imagine the increase of it when he told me his
real name. I looked at the murderer, and could scarcely
believe my own eyes; yet he stood before me a living
marvel. I have pledged secresy as to his real name until
after his execution. I interrogated him on his first steps
in vice, and how he became so hardened. He told me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>to remember the treatment he had received from the
Lynchers' lash at Vicksburg. I did, but my eyes could
scarcely credit reality. I had known him in 1832, 1833,
1834, and in the early part of 1835, as a bar-keeper in
Vicksburg. He was never a shrewd card-player, but at
that time was considered an inoffensive youth. The coffee-house
he kept was owned by North, who, with four others,
were executed on the 5th of July, 1835, by Lynch law.
Wyatt and three others were taken on the morning of
the 7th, stripped, and one thousand lashes given to the
four, tarred and feathered, and put into a canoe and set
adrift on the Mississippi river. It makes my blood curdle
and my flesh quiver to think of the suffering condition of
these unfortunate men, set adrift on the morning of the
7th of July, with the broiling sun upon their mangled
bodies. Two died in about two hours after they were set
afloat. Wyatt and another remained with their hands
and feet bound forty hours, suffering more than tongue
can tell or pen describe, when they were picked up by
some slave negroes, who started with the two survivors to
their quarters. His companion died before they arrived.
Wyatt survives to tell the horrors of the Lyncher's lash.
He told me seven murders had been occasioned by their
unmerciful treatment to him, and one innocent man hung.
I know his statements to be true, for I had known him
before 1835, and his truth in other particulars cannot be
doubted. He murdered his seventh man, for which
crime he will be executed. I have another communication
for your paper concerning the murderer, and his
prospects in the world to come.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Yours, truly,<br /></span>

<p class="rightheader">From the Christian Advocate and Journal.</p>

<p class="center">GREEN'S SECOND VISIT TO AUBURN STATE PRISON.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Bond</span>:</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;I made my second visit to the prison on
Sabbath morning, the 6th instant, accompanied by the
Boston Quartet Club. As we were winding our way
through the halls and passing the gloomy cells, I felt sad
and melancholy upon reflecting on the purpose of so large
a prison. Is it possible, thought I, that our heaven-favoured
land of freedom requires institutions of so extensive
a character as this to keep down the vices of a people
who boast of their morality? Yet, horrible as it appeared
to me, I thought, if many of the foreign travellers, who
are ever ready to criticise and condemn our institutions,
were conducted through the Auburn State Prison, without
any intimation of its design, they would put it down
in their journals of travel as an institution to diffuse literary
science and useful knowledge; and from what we
have learned of institutions of the latter kind, under monarchical
governments, we have little hesitation in saying,
that they would not compare well with this prison. Nor
would they be willing that some of their plans for the
diffusion of useful knowledge, in the way of charity,
should be compared, in respect to health and religious
principles, with this institution, intended only for the
punishment and prevention of crime, and the reformation
of criminals. And if it be the fact, that our state's prison
is better calculated than some foreign institutions designed
to educate the poor of the land for this same pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>pose,
it certainly will stand good that our land of liberty
is comparatively the land of morality.</p>

<p>We entered the chapel, where were seated nearly eight
hundred convicts, and something like one hundred citizens,
who had been admitted for the purpose of hearing
the sweet melody of the Boston Quartet Club, and to
hear the reformed gambler speak upon a vice which had
brought over one hundred within the gloomy walls of a
state's prison. Service commenced with prayer by the
chaplain, Rev. O.E. Morrill. The Boston Quartet Club
then sung the beautiful sacred piece, "Hear my Prayer,"
during which breathless silence made manifest that the
music was enjoyed. I was then introduced as the reformed
gambler, Mr. J. H. Green. When I arose, there
was profound silence throughout the chapel, to hear my
sad experience. I felt perfectly incompetent to give satisfaction
to an audience, partly composed of the most hardened
wretches that infest our land&mdash;men who are steeped
to the very lips in degradation, many of whom are men
of talent, well-educated, and well acquainted with most
of the leading topics of the day, knowing, too, as I did,
that an error might be construed into an insult; and to
such men an insult is unpardonable. I commenced by
relating my sad experience, and in a few minutes there
could scarcely be seen a dry cheek in that vast assembly
of depraved men. My address being closed, the prisoners
were marched in order to their dining-room.</p>

<p>The chaplain and myself visited the cell of Wyatt, the
murderer. We found him sitting upon the straw which
covered the floor. He seemed to be somewhat indifferent
when the chaplain first spoke to him, but upon his second
speech, telling that Mr. Green had again called to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>him, he sprung to his feet and shook hands with me&mdash;said
he was glad I had called&mdash;that he had been fearful
I had left the prison, after giving my address, without
seeing him, and added, "Mr. Green, I would love to hear
you give your experience." I told him of the attention
the prisoners had given me, and the advice I had
given them, about signing the anti-gambling pledge, so
soon as they were released&mdash;to come out with their sad
experience, and they would find the good and generous-hearted
ever ready to receive them. He turned round to
the chaplain and said, "How much good such a society
as that would have done, had it been formed before I became
a gambler!&mdash;How many men it would have saved
from the dagger of the midnight murderer! But it is too
late to save me." I changed the subject, by asking him
about different gamblers of our country. We talked
about many with whom we both had been intimate.
Some, he tells me, now live in your empire city, and
were leading men among the politicians in the last presidential
contest. I knew them to be leading men. I
knew them to be gamblers and swaggering bullies; and I
knew them to be at one time connected with Wyatt, but
did not know them to be murderers; yet they certainly
are.</p>

<p>Wyatt asked me if they permitted such men to vote?
I told him they did. Said he, "A gambler should not be
entitled to a vote, nor to his oath." He spoke correctly;
and said he, "The day is not far distant when the man,
who is known to the world as a gambler, will not be
countenanced." Neither his vote nor his oath would be
taken at the present day, if the citizens, who are the
bone and sinew of the country, would take into considera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>tion
his real principles. He said, "No man who bets
upon elections should be entitled to his vote, nor to his
oath; for a man who can be excited to bet upon an election,
can be excited when upon oath to stretch the blanket;
or, in plainer language, to swear to a lie. Such I believe
to be facts." "And lotteries are another species of villany,"
said he; "the money goes to the vendor, and
makes his victim poor and dishonest. Such I know to be
facts." Pleased to hear a man, situated as Wyatt, the
murderer, is, reason so candidly, I changed the subject, in
order to learn more about the murders he had committed.
I knew that a man, in the year 1839, was missing from
Natchez, by the name of Tucker, and by the run of Wyatt's
discourse, I found he was in that part about the
same time.</p>

<p>I told Wyatt that a man by the name of Tucker was
supposed to have been murdered about that date between
Natchez and New Orleans. He laughed, and said he
knew something about it. "Myself and three others,"
said he, "went to Natchez as produce speculators.
Tucker owned a boat load of produce. We contracted
for it, advanced him money sufficient to pay off his hands,
telling him we had sufficient help; that he could go with us
to New Orleans, and that on our arrival there, we would
pay him the balance due. He did so. We paid him in
a Mississippi bath. We murdered him, and then threw
him overboard." I asked him if he ever was suspected.
He said, not that he knew of. I asked him if he was not
afraid, when he was committing such a murder, that the
body might rise upon the water and be the means of their
being suspected. "We cut their entrails out," said he,
"then they never rise until resurrection-day." I felt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>heart-sick at his dreadful description of the murder of
Tucker. I knew him. He was a good, honest man. I
arose from my seat, took him by the hand, and bade him
good day, promising him to call again. I will, in my next,
inform you of the particulars of my third visit, which will
lead you further into his dreadful history. I will in my
next also speak of his views on the subject of religion.</p>

<p>The following letter was written and published by the
unanimous consent of every honest citizen of Cleveland,
Ohio, of which place I can only speak in the language
of commendation. It is one of the most virtuous cities
in the state, according to its population; and from the
interest two of the principal organs took in behalf of the
anti-gambling cause, I am certain that no filthy sheet can
ever pollute its moral principles.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Cleveland Plaindealer</i>:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gray</span>, Sir&mdash;The Herald of last evening contained
a letter over the signature of O.E. Morrill, dated July
25th, 1845, charging J. H. Green, "the Reformed Gambler,"
with misrepresenting the confessions made to him
by "Wyatt, the murderer." The Anti-Gambling Society
of this city have requested me, as its President, to publish
the following letter, in justice to Mr. Green, and in
answer to Mr. Morrill. It was written on the 12th of
July last, in reply to Mr. Morrill's "private note," re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>ferred
to in his letter published last evening. A true
copy was made, and the original forwarded to Mr. O.E.
Morrill on the day of its date, by Dr. Cowles, of this city.
Deeming this letter a complete refutation of the charges
against Mr. Green, the Society have taken the liberty,
without his knowledge, of requesting you to place it
before the public.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Your obedient servant,<br /></span>
<span class="smcap i8">John E. Cary.</span></p>
<p>Cleveland, August 5, 1845.</p>

<p>[This letter was written in reply to a letter addressed
me by the Rev. O.E. Morrill, requesting my return to
Auburn, fifteen days previous to his publishing my statements
as false, and letter No. 7 will show in what manner
I replied.]</p>



<h4>No. 5.</h4>

<p class="rightheader">Cleveland, July 12, 1845.</p>


<p><i>Mr. O.E. Morrill:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear sir</span>,&mdash;I have just received yours of the 10th.
Speaking in regard to Wyatt's case, you state that you
was very much surprised at my letters. Why did you
not tell me so before they were published? You also
heard both the first and second letter before I left your
section. Why did you not object to them before?</p>

<p>Again, you say, some parts are my own representations.
This I deny. I will not say that I have given
them verbatim, but this I do say, and will maintain, that
I have not exaggerated in my statements.</p>

<p>Yet I do not wish to injure that poor doomed man.
God forbid. I do not think as you do about Wyatt. I
know him better than you do, or can. I know that he
has been the child of circumstances. I know that he is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>not a man who will strictly confine himself to the truth;
and fear of death will make him do any thing that he is
told to do. His denying what he told me, I care nothing
for. In my statements, if they were not correct from
him to me, I am not accountable; I believe them to be
facts.</p>

<p>Now for a few questions to brighten your memory.
When we entered his cell for the first time, you introduced
me as a man who had lived in the south. I interrogated
him on his past life. Did I not commence at
Huntsville, in the year 1832, and trace him to November,
1835, at the mouth of the Ohio, with the Texas troops?
When he told me that he had known me up to that date,
that he also saw me at St. Louis, do you not recollect his
asking me if I had not heard of a man being murdered
in, or near St. Louis, one man hung, and the other acquitted?
And do you not recollect I told him I thought
I did; also, that at the same time I was informed, that
the people thought that the guilty man was cleared, and
the innocent one hung. He laughed, and said he was
the guilty one, or something amounting to the same?
Do you recollect, in your own letter to the Tribune, you
stated that over fifty gamblers were recognised, with
whose doleful history we were both familiar? Also, do
you not recollect his telling about their lynching him;
about the cords cutting his arms? Do you not recollect
when I talked about the Tucker, or flat-boat murder, he
told how they cut out the entrails, to prevent the body
from rising? Do you not recollect that you and myself
talked the same over at your house? You certainly cannot
forget. He told me so much, I can think of but little,
which I thought most essential to remember. I am will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ing
to say nothing more about his case, until his execution;
if I am satisfied it will be beneficial to the community,
as well as Wyatt. But to retract one syllable, I
cannot, unless I find myself mistaken, in which case I
will make any acknowledgment necessary.</p>

<p>You ask, or say, that, if I come back, something may
be done satisfactorily. I presume it can be done without
my coming. You can write to me at this city; I shall
remain here two weeks. I suppose the change of officers
has made some in relation to the confession, of which I
know nothing about, but there is no fabrication, as far as
I am concerned, and the fact of a newspaper quarrel between
you and I cannot fail to injure, or at least excite
the people more against him. You say you will be
forced into it. Do not be hasty. I do not fear any inconvenience
from any act of mine, but, of course, if you
contradict my statements, I have the same chance to support
them; and, perhaps, there are some facts, which,
when revealed, will make you better satisfied that the
confession you have of Wyatt is not more than one-fourth
true. His dates are almost every one incorrect.
His crimes are enlarged in some places, diminished in
others. You have the best right to his confessions, if he
alters it, and you have the most truthful history. I told
you when we parted, that I knew things relative to
Wyatt, which he would never tell you, with which you
should be benefited after the trial. They are in my possession,
and I will not reveal them until he has been tried,
unless it should be necessary to show the fact of his
(Wyatt's) horrible character.</p>

<p>What has been said by me, cannot so far injure Wyatt,
unless it is perverted. But what I have said are facts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>which I will not retract, and they are of that nature which
need no retractation. My memory is as good as yours.
I am striving to do right, the same as yourself, and will
contend that you are as liable to be mistaken as I am,
especially when I knew him in different circumstances.
I blame you not for doing every thing that is right to
make Wyatt as happy as he can be, under his present
circumstances, but be careful that you are right.</p>

<p>I leave this matter for your consideration, believing
that you will do what is correct, so far as you are able.
You can rest assured, that I will do any thing in my
power to assist. You will find, however, that I am correct
in my statements. Write me, and your letter shall
have immediate attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Oliphant</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>,&mdash;In justice to an unfortunate prisoner, now in
chains awaiting his trial at the next sitting of the court
in this place, I feel in duty bound to say to the public,
that whatever Wyatt's character or conduct may have
been, or however many murders he may have committed,
and may ultimately be revealed to the public through the
proper channels&mdash;yet all Mr. Green has said about Wyatt's
having confided to him, that he, with three others,
were whipped a thousand lashes at Vicksburg, which
had been the cause of seven murders, and that Gordon
was the seventh man that he (Wyatt) had killed, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>he (Wyatt) positively killed the man at St. Louis, for
which an innocent man was hung&mdash;and that he (Wyatt)
said <i>he</i> killed Tucker in 1839, between Natchez and
New Orleans, is <i>untrue</i> to my <i>certain</i> knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Green's visits were all made in my presence, while
Wyatt was confined in his cell, a room some four by seven
feet in size; hence, all that passed between them could
be distinctly heard and known by all three of us.</p>

<p>I have no disposition to injure Mr. Green, but I should
do violence to every principle of justice and humanity,
were I to remain silent, and see a fellow-being tried for
his life in the midst of that prejudice which has already
condemned the criminal to a thousand deaths, by Mr.
Green's published declarations of Wyatt's own confessions
of bloody deeds and horrid murders, when, in reality,
the prisoner has made no such confessions to him, to my
certain knowledge.</p>

<p>To avoid this unpleasant task, I addressed a private
note to Mr. Green, calling for a satisfactory explanation;
but, in his reply, he utterly refuses a single retraction,
and the only alternative left me is to let the prisoner suffer
this great injustice, or disabuse the public mind from the
wrong impressions made by fabrications of Mr. Green.</p>

<p>I hope to be spared the disagreeable necessity of resorting
to the newspapers of the day to correct any further
improprieties of Mr. Green on this subject. If I am not,
I will give a specific catalogue of them in my next.</p>

<p>All editors of newspapers, whether political or religious,
are requested to give the above an insertion in their columns,
as an act of justice to an injured man, and very
much oblige.</p>

<h4>No. 7.</h4>

<p class="rightheader">Toledo, August 5, 1845.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the New York Tribune:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear sir</span>,&mdash;I beg leave to introduce to your columns
the following article, written for the purpose of satisfying
the honest part of the community, that a letter written by
the Rev. O.E. Morrill, on the 25th of July last, is an
unprincipled misrepresentation of my purpose, in bringing
to light the horrid deeds of murder committed by
Wyatt, now in the Auburn State Prison.</p>

<p>I visited Wyatt four times, in company with Mr. Morrill,
Chaplain of the Prison. The time I spent with him
in all these visits was about five hours, during which we
conversed about his former course of life. It is impossible
for me to state in one article all that he revealed to
me, but what I do remember, I published in my letters,
relative to my visits to the cell of Wyatt. The second
of these letters was dated April 7th, and the first about
the 1st of April. I read both these letters to the reverend
gentleman; the first before it went to press, and the
second as soon as published, we being at both times together,
with some officers of the institution, in the State
Prison office.</p>

<p>I now call the attention of the reader to a letter, from
the reverend gentleman, to the editor of the New York
Tribune, of the date of April 7th, in which he speaks in
the highest terms of my conduct. The reader will notice
that this is after my first letter was published, and after
he had heard them both read, and after he knew that I
had given Wyatt's confessions, which he now, in his
letter of July 25th, declares to be nothing more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
"fabrications" of mine. If my statement of Wyatt's
confession were known to Mr. Morrill to be false, why
did he recommend me so highly in his letter of April 7th,
and why has he not contradicted me before this? The
reverend gentleman says, that he did not wish to injure
me, and so addressed me a private note. If I could be
so base as to put forth to the world such falsehoods as he
accuses me of, in regard to a fellow-being, so soon to be
launched into eternity, no fear of injury to me can excuse
the gentleman for his not exposing me immediately to
public scorn and detestation.</p>

<p>When at Auburn, after my visits to the cell, I spoke
several times, in the presence of Mr. Morrill, and other
gentlemen, of Wyatt's confessions to me; and yet Mr.
Morrill, though present, never disputed one relation. I
also lectured some fifty times, within fifty miles of Auburn,
and, in nearly all, gave the same statements which
he now contradicts. Why has not Mr. Morrill published,
together with his contradiction, my reply to his note of
July 10th? If he had, the community would have seen
my reasons for not retracting my former statements.</p>

<p>I am truly sorry to have any difficulty with the reverend
gentleman, on this subject or any other, but my duty
in regard to this malicious slander, (the motives of which
I am unable to fathom,) compels me to reply, and for no
other purpose than to satisfy the community, that I could
have no personal object in view, in casting a stigma upon
the character of this unfortunate convict, by any statement
he made to me, for I certainly could not be benefited
in any manner by publishing falsehoods in relation
to him.</p>

<p>I repeat again to the world, and ever will, that the un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>fortunate
Wyatt did to me confess all I stated he did, and
much more, which it is impossible for me to remember.
If he stated falsehoods to me, I am not responsible. He
told me that he was one of <i>four</i> that had received a thousand
lashes at Vicksburg, in July, 1835; and I knew a
young man, by the name of Henry North, to be about
Vicksburg, and to be in the employment of North, the
gambler, who was hung at Vicksburg, by the <i>lynchers</i>,
in July, 1835. Henry, though of the same name, was
not related to the other, as I understood. When I went
to the south in the fall of 1835, I inquired about the gamblers
of Vicksburg, and was told that Henry North, alias
Wyatt, or Newell, was, with four others, whipped, tarred
and feathered, hands bound, and set afloat, and the supposition
was that he, and the others with him, existed no
more. When Wyatt told me his real name, I was surprised
at beholding him. He told me that he had set fire
twice to Vicksburg, and once to Natchez, and that, during
the conflagration, he murdered <i>three</i> men. He told me
he killed Tucker in 1839. I talked with Mr. Morrill
before several officers of the prison, in regard to what
Wyatt said about cutting the entrails out of Tucker, and
the confession which Mr. Morrill now has from Wyatt
will show the main circumstances of this murder, perhaps
not giving Tucker's name, but he speaks about the flat-boat
murder, between Natchez and New Orleans, and I
claim it, in justice to me, that the reverend gentleman
should produce the confession Wyatt made, when he
speaks of "speculation on the Mississippi."</p>

<p>I also call on Mr. Morrill, in justice to myself and the
public, to answer the following questions. 1st. Did not
Wyatt confess in his presence the murder of individuals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>besides Tucker, on the Mississippi? 2d. Did he not say
he cut the entrails out to prevent their rising? 3d. Did
he not say he was tried at St. Louis under another name,
(I think it was North,) and did I not turn to Mr. Morrill,
and say, I knew some men had been tried at St. Louis,
but knew none of the parties; and did not Wyatt then
say that he was tried for murder at St. Louis, that he was
convicted on his first trial, but acquitted on a new trial,
and that an innocent man was hung? 4th. Did I not tell
Mr. Morrill, that Wyatt informed me that he had been a
convict in the Ohio Penitentiary; and does not Mr. Morrill
recollect that upon my third visit to Wyatt's cell, I
said to Wyatt, that it was reported he had been in the
Ohio Penitentiary, at which Wyatt frowned, and I
changed the tenor of my question by stating, that Gordon
said he (Wyatt) had been there, and that Wyatt laughed,
and said it was such d&mdash;d lies which occasioned Gordon's
death; and did not Mr. Morrill say to me, he knew many
of Wyatt's <i>misfortunes</i>, which he kept secret from the
agent of the prison; and will Mr. Merrill deny that when
we went into the office, after my last visit, that the clerk
again repeated that Wyatt had been in the Ohio Prison,
and did not I then decide with the clerk, the probability
of such being the fact, and did not Mr. Morrill still <i>insist</i>
that it was a false report?</p>

<p><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a></p>
<p>In conclusion I will say, that whatever may be the
reverend gentleman's intentions towards me, and in his
own behalf the motives for which I am not able to penetrate;
yet, although he brands my statements as false,
and although the cell was but four by seven feet in size, I
leave it to the community to decide, whether two men, who
can speak the "flash language," in which one word can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>convey sentences, may not hold a conversation not easily
understood by a third person, ignorant of its meaning&mdash;and
can Mr. Morrill assert what meaning was conveyed
by such language between Wyatt and myself? if so, he
is the first man I ever knew that could interpret a language
or tongue he never studied. At least one-fourth
of the conversation between Wyatt and myself before
Mr. Morrill, was of this kind. I do not think Mr. Morrill
understood all he heard, yet the greater part of what
I published in my letters was spoken in plain English,
and Mr. Morrill, at the time, gave vent to his feelings
over the dreadful disclosures.</p>

<p>I ask the papers of the day to publish this statement
in justice to both parties, as well as the public at large.</p>

<p class="rightheader">Correspondence of the New York Tribune.</p>

<p class="rightheader">Perrysburgh, Ohio, August 16, 1845.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Greeley</i>,&mdash;I wish to introduce to the columns of
your valuable paper the following. Though it may seem
mysterious and out of date, it will be read with much interest
by many, and may have a tendency to cast a light upon one
of the most horrible murders ever committed in this or any
other Christian land. There is not one shade of doubt
remaining in my mind but that the murderers, as well as
their victim or victims, long before the date of this article,
might have been discovered, had there been sufficient
effort made. True, efforts have at last been made, and
the skeleton of one murdered victim found, and much
search made for the other. The particulars which led
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>to the but small effort which has already been made, are
collected from circumstances as follows:&mdash;As near as we
can learn, in September, 1844, a gentleman, by the name
of Stephens, from the state of New York, made his appearance
in Perrysburgh, remained in and near some
days, left, sometime after returned. About the time of
his departure from the second visit, he made known his
business, that he had kept secret until the time near his
departure. He then told that two men had been murdered,
and their bodies concealed in the woods about one-half
mile from the last turnpike gate, which is about four
miles from Perrysburgh. His statements corroborating
some previous signs of murder, induced the citizens to
turn out and scout the swamp in search, knowing as they
did that certain packages of clothes had been found in the
Maumee river by a fisherman, on the 17th April, 1844.
The clothes found were done up in parcels, coat, pantaloons,
and vest, with a stone tied round each, with strips
of handkerchiefs cut or torn for the purpose. Upon examination,
the clothes were cut in a way to show they
had been ripped off from the body. The pantaloon's legs
cut open; the coat cut open from the back and sleeves;
the vest also cut open from the back. The coat had
many cuts in the left sleeve, also a hole about the lower
button on the right side, which hole was in the pantaloons,
cutting the lower suspender in two. The vest had
several cuts in it, immediately back of the neck, through
the collar, and two knife holes. The vest is a figured
worsted piece of goods, of lilac colour, about half-worn.
The coat is a black cloth frock, or surtout, but little worn,
no velvet upon it, lined inside of the skirts with black
silk or serge, the sleeve lining twilled linen. Inside of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>the left sleeve is a mark of the merchant, which is one
cipher&mdash;nothing more. From the looks, I should have
taken the coat to have cost twenty dollars. The pantaloons
are rather of a blue colour, striped casinet, and
have never been worn much. The suspender, which
has been cut in two, is a common striped web. The two
handkerchiefs are figured silk, half-worn. When they
were found, it was evident they had not been long in the
water. I have a piece of each garment, and persons
who have missed any of their friends mysteriously perhaps
might find, upon examination, that which would
lead them to know their friend had suffered death from
the hands of a murderer. A sample of each I will keep
to exhibit through the country, hoping to solve the
mystery.</p>

<p>Now for the mysterious visits of Mr. Stephens. About
his departure from the second visit, he disclosed certain
things, which I will give according to my information.
He said he had been informed by certain convicts, then
in the New York State Prison at Auburn, that they had
murdered two men in the said swamp, and had concealed
their bodies. One they had stripped; the other, left his
clothing upon him. They stated that the murdered men
were travelling in a buggy, and that they (the murderers)
stopped the buggy, presented their pistols, forced them
into the woods, where they shot one, and stabbed and
butchered the other. Not far from the same place, a hat
was found with a bullet-hole in it, but no sign was left
upon the body found which would indicate that he had
been brought to his death by a ball, which also goes farther
to prove the probability of the murder of two men. They
buried them, as they state, about one-half mile apart, strip
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ping the clothes off from one, which they took along with
them in the buggy, and made their way to the Maumee river.
Not thinking it politic to cross at the toll-bridge, they
went up to the ford, near Fort Meigs, and found the river
not in a fording state. They tied stones to the clothes
and threw them in the river, where they were afterward
found, and crossed the bridge to the north side of the
river, went below Toledo, took the buggy to pieces, sank
it and the harness in the river, and took the horse out
back of Manhattan and killed it. In the early part of
the summer following two men were arrested near Geneseo,
New York, for committing burglary. Apprehension
of another attack almost forbids me giving their names,
while duty doubly nerves me to speak and let the public
know that <i>Wyatt</i>, alias Newell, or North, and Head, his
accomplice in the burglary at Geneseo, are the two murderers
who gave Mr. Stephens his information, and caused
his visit to ascertain the truth of such horrid deeds.
Other circumstances leave no doubt resting with the people
of this part that the same two men, Wyatt and Head,
murdered John Parish, of Hancock county, while attempting
to arrest them for horse-stealing. A small explanation
of this fact I will make. It will be remembered by
many that Wyatt attempted to make his escape from the
Auburn prison, and when Gordon, the man he afterward
murdered, told the keepers, he was searched, and upon
his person a letter was found, which letter contained no
names of men or places, nor was it directed; but from the
purport, it was evidently written for the purpose of sending
to Ohio, for it stated that he dare not venture back, as
the people would recognise him as the murderer of a certain
officer who had made an attempt to arrest him. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>reader will also recollect that Wyatt, under the name of
Newell, resided in Toledo in the commencement of 1844
until April 1st, 1844, when he left Toledo, and was not
heard of until Mr. Stephens' revelation. I would say, in
conclusion, so far as this statement may have a tendency
to excite the citizens to their duties, relative to those mysterious
murders, that I hope those concerned in ferreting
out the particulars hereafter will not have a malignant
feeling for any stranger who may come among them to
assist, not for honour or profit, as, undoubtedly, so far as
this mysterious affair is concerned, some of the principal
workers have made the two latter-mentioned their object.
I believe this, so far, to be the most correct account of
those mysterious murders, and if it is thought by any
concerned that a more able report can be given, come out
and do your duty.</p>

<p><span class="i8">J. H. GREEN.</span></p>


<p>This article is introduced for several purposes&mdash;all of
which we consider of importance to substantiate the facts
we have laid before them. Those murders, near Perrysburgh,
were committed by Wyatt and Head, his colleague,
who is now in the State Prison at Auburn, New York.
After the controversy had taken place, I availed myself
of the opportunity to search into facts concerning Wyatt,
and found, in addition to those set forth in the preceding
letter, the following:&mdash;Wyatt, alias Robert Henry North,
was hired as a stage-driver near Chillicothe, Ohio, in the
latter part of 1838, but decamped in a short time afterwards
with a horse belonging to another man, and made
his way to Portsmouth, Ohio; where he was taken and
carried back to Chillicothe, tried, and convicted to serve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>three years in the Ohio Penitentiary. In 1841 he was
released. He then left for Missouri, where he again got
into difficulty, which detained him until 1843. He told
me he was tried for his life in St. Louis, convicted, got a
new trial, and was acquitted. If he was, it was under a
different name from any above mentioned, and the murder
he was tried for must have been Major Floyd. But I do
not believe he was one of those tried, and acquitted, as he
professed to be. He then made his way across the country
to Louisville, Kentucky. From there to a town called
Mount Gilead, in Ashland county, Ohio, where he went
to work at the business of tailoring, a trade he had learned
in the Ohio State Prison. In a short time after he arrived
there, he married a very respectable lady, with
whom, for the short period they lived together, he led a
very disagreeable life. In the latter part of 1843, or the
beginning of 1844, he left for Toledo, Ohio, where he
hired out, and lived up to the time spoken of in the preceding
letter, and where he committed the crimes referred
to in the same. After which, he made his escape to the
state of New York, in company with the notorious villain,
Head, where they committed a burglary, and were sentenced
to the Auburn State Prison from Geneseo.
When Wyatt arrived at the penitentiary, he was recognised
by an old companion who had served in the Ohio
Penitentiary, by the name of Gordon. Gordon gave information
to the keepers, of Wyatt's having served a time
in the penitentiary in Ohio. Wyatt became enraged,
and despairing of any chance of a pardon, being sentenced,
I think, for fourteen years, he tried to effect his escape,
but was detected and severely punished. He then swore
vengeance against Gordon, whose time was nearly ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>pired;
and on Saturday, the 15th of March, 1845, he
secreted about his person one-half of a pair of shears,
given him to work with in the tailor's shop, which he
reserved until the next day, (Sabbath, the 16th,) and as
the prisoners were marching to their cells from their dinners,
stabbed Gordon in the right side, immediately below
the ribs. The instrument passed towards his spine,
through one of the main arteries, killing him almost instantly,
and for this last deed he was hanged.</p>

<p>Finally, let me say to those who may be anxious to
know more of the history of this unfortunate man, and of
his crimes, that I have looked with great anxiety for the
third letter, spoken of in my second to the Christian Advocate
and Journal. That the mystery of their not appearing
has been no fault of mine. I wrote four letters,
and but two appeared. Whether they were detained by
the false and garbled statements which have been set
forth by the Rev. O.E. Morrill, or whether they have
ever been received, I am unable to say. However, I
have written twice to Dr. Bond, and, as yet, I have not
been able to learn by what authority they have been detained.
But should I have them returned, the public
may be welcome to them for their worth.</p>

<p>Since the execution, we learned from those present,
that Wyatt was taken from his cell, faint from the loss of
blood he had shed a few days before, in his attempt to
commit suicide. When seated in his chair, under the
gallows, he made remarks like the following: "I have
lived like a man, I will die like a man. I am not afraid
to die. I am about to enter eternity, and appear before
my God. My conduct has been misrepresented&mdash;men
have sworn falsely against me&mdash;I cannot and will not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>forgive them&mdash;I am not the man I have been represented
to be&mdash;I did not commit the murder charged upon me in
Ohio. I am thankful to the sheriff and his family for
their kindness." He manifested no religious penitence to
the last. He died an unbeliever.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In conclusion, I would say to those who have perused
this work, so full of strange and startling incidents, let not
their mysterious and dark character cause you to doubt
of their truth. Recollect that there are strange events in
the life of every man, many of which he cannot fathom;
and were the whole circumstances of your own life disclosed,
it is not impossible that many of them would exceed
belief. Horrible as is the picture of depravity here
exhibited, the half has not been told, nor would I reveal
one iota more than I deemed necessary to awaken the
public attention to a sense of their danger, and a corresponding
sense of their duty. Reader, you may be standing
upon the edge of a precipice, though you know it
not. Fathers, your sons may frequent these haunts of
vice, and be entangled in the snares of the destroyer.
Wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, lend us your aid to
save those you love from destruction. You need not be
ignorant, that around you are hundreds of individuals
who live in affluence upon the spoils of their industry.
It is not gamblers that support gaming. If the merchant,
and lawyer, and tradesman, and the man of fortune
did not supply them with the material, their profession
would die. In all my works I have shown how gambling
lends to, and is connected with, all other crimes;
and I beseech you, as you love your families, yourselves,
and our common country, that you lend your aid and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>fluence
to abate this evil. This vast conspiracy against
your lives and fortunes, which I have here developed, is
no chimera. Its workings are everywhere felt, though
the machinery is unseen. I have no object but your good
in making this disclosure; and should it meet the eye,
as I have no doubt it will, of some one not a stranger to
its crimes, I beseech him to consider his ways. Why
should he live a curse to the earth&mdash;a destroyer of his
kind&mdash;a blot upon creation&mdash;a dishonour to his Maker?
Heaven and earth are equally ready to receive the returning
prodigal. The only danger&mdash;the only disgrace is to
continue where you are. In behalf of our Maker, in behalf
of humanity, in behalf of all that is noble and virtuous,
I beseech you to <span class="smcap">turn</span>, <i>why will ye die</i>?</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap" style="font-size: 80%;">Mr. Freeman the avowed gambler, and Mr. Green,
the reformed gambler; before the citizens of
Philadelphia, in the Lecture-room of the Chinese
Museum, on the Evenings of the 10th, 13th, and
15th of May, 1847.</span></h2>

<p><i>Mr. Freeman's challenge, and Mr. Green's acceptance,
as published in the papers of the city of Philadelphia</i>.</p>

<p class="center">From the Inquirer.</p>

<p>It is well known that Mr. Green, the Reformed Gambler,
gave a Lecture at the Museum on Monday night last, in
which he exposed the arts and devices of the Gambling
Fraternity of the Union. His audience was quite large,
and his illustrations were listened to with no little interest.
It seems from the following article, which we copy
from the Sun of yesterday, that a professional Gambler was
present. His Card or Challenge is quite a curiosity:</p>

<p>Mr. Editor:&mdash;Having attended the Lecture of J. H.
Green, last evening, at the Chinese Museum, on the
popular vice of Gambling, and differing from him in each
and in every view which he took, and which he is in the
habit of taking upon that subject, I beg leave respectfully
to say to him through the medium of your columns, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
I have made up my mind to confront him in debate, in
regard to the right and wrong of the subject in question.
I say, I am willing so to do, provided it meets his views,
and those of the community. If he, and those who admire
his theory, are the friends of truth, surely they will
not shrink from investigation?&mdash;and if I cannot sustain
myself in debate, why, his triumph will add strength to
his cause.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>who</i> I am, I will say in a single word
that I am a professional Gambler. I shall set out, if we
meet, to prove to the audience, among other things, that
in his illustrations of the cheatery which he says the
gambler practices upon his victim, he is actually at that
very moment practising a palpable cheat upon the very
audience which he is proposing to enlighten. As regards
any profits that may arise from such a meeting, I
want none, although perhaps as needy as Mr. Green.</p>

<p>As regards experience in debate, Mr. G. has decidedly
the advantage of me in that respect. I have had the honour
of addressing public audiences four times in my
whole life, and but four&mdash;two of these were in favour of
Old Tip, in 1840, and the other two upon the subject
of temperance. I am well aware that there are many
persons who would look upon it as a sort of inconsistency
that a man, occupying my position, should be the honest
advocate of temperance&mdash;but they so reason because they
are uninformed in regard to the higher order of gambling!</p>

<p>Should Mr. Green accede to my proposition, he only
has to name his time and place&mdash;or if he prefers to
have a personal interview, he can do so. I am willing
to wait on him at his boarding-house, but would like to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>have at least one respectable person present to hear all that
passes between us.</p>

<p><span class="i8">J.G. FREEMAN.</span></p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;I am a native of South Carolina; I am known
from Virginia to Orleans. Mr. Green I have seen in
that city, and he no doubt recollects me, though I never
had any intimacy with him.</p>

<p>We publish below another communication from Mr.
Freeman, in which he announces that Mr. Green has accepted
his challenge to debate, and lays down his points
for argument. We are glad of this, and have no doubt
the public will share in our curiosity to know what kind of
a defence can be made by a gambler, even so <i>polished</i> as
Mr. Freeman, for a vice fitly characterized by Mr. Green
as "fifty per cent. worse than stealing." Expectation is
on tiptoe.</p>

<p class="center">Communicated for the Sun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Editor</span>&mdash;I return to you my sincere thanks for
having kindly published my letter to Mr. J. H. Green,
the reformed gambler; and beg leave now to state to you,
that I have had an interview with him, and that he fully
consents to go into the debate. It now devolves upon me,
since I have assumed the character of <i>plaintiff</i> in the action,
to define minutely the exact points to be discussed.</p>

<p>The first position, then, that I shall assume, is that all
those states in this Union that have enacted very severe
laws against gambling, such as making it a penitentiary
offence, &amp;c., have acted both tyrannically and unwisely&mdash;<i>tyrannically</i>,
because they are an infringement upon
those sacred reserved rights that never were yielded in
what law commentators call the "social compact"&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<i>unwise</i>, because their tendency is to generate immorality
rather than stop it.</p>

<p>The second ground that I shall take, is that the character
of that class of beings called "gamblers" is less
understood by the community at large, and especially by
that portion of it that have had no intercourse with them,
than any class of men in the world. That it has ever
been the misfortune of the gambler to be misrepresented,
not only of late by Mr. Green, but generally by those that
have attempted to portray his character in the prints.</p>

<p>I shall undertake to show him up in his true character,
making it neither better nor worse than it really is&mdash;"<i>Let
justice be done if the heavens fall.</i>"</p>

<p>In the third place, I shall propose to prove beyond question,
that cheating at cards is decidedly the most unfortunate
thing for the cause of gambling and gamblers, that
possibly could exist. And on the other hand, that it is
the very saviour of that portion of mankind who have a
sneaking fondness for play.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, I will attempt to prove that those
tricks that Mr. Green is in the habit of illustrating with
cards, are entirely worthless; that they can <i>not</i> be reduced
to practice; that if they can, it must be on persons
wholly destitute of common sense; that an opinion
that he can tell any cards by the back, is entirely untrue;
that neither he nor any other man can do any such thing,
unless the cards have been marked either by himself or
some other person.</p>

<p>In the course of those proceedings, I shall take upon
myself, for the benefit of the young and inexperienced who
may be present, to make such developments as will be
of lasting importance to them in their sojourn through this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>mazy world; for, as Mr. Calhoun once said of the Constitution
of the United States, if there be any one man
that loves innocent youth better than all others, I claim to
be that man. To seduce one into <i>any</i> vicious habit when
uncontaminated, is a thing I would <i>scorn</i> to do. And the
pleasure which I feel, when I reflect upon it, of having
actually saved some half dozen from ruin, is to me unspeakable.
But for this I know I am never to be credited;
for Mr. Green has informed us that the gambler is <i>hardened</i>,
for he never goes to church, and if you reach him
at all it must be with a penitentiary act.</p>

<p>But, pardon me, Messrs. Editors, this is not the time
nor the place for the argument.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Yours, respectfully,<br /></span>
<span class="smcap i8">J.G. Freeman.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Green says he will inform me on to-morrow when
it will suit to have the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Green, it will be seen by the following letter, has
consented to meet his challenger in debate on the subject
of gambling. We are glad of this, inasmuch as Mr.
Freeman is said to be quite an intelligent gentleman, and
stands at the head of his <i>profession</i>. The discussion,
if conducted in a proper spirit, will be attended by good
results.&mdash;<span class="smcap">ed</span>.</p>

<p class="center">For the Daily Sun.</p>

<p class="rightheader">Philadelphia, April 29, 1847.</p>


<p><i>Messrs. Barrett &amp; Jones</i>:&mdash;In the "Sun" of the 28th
and 29th inst. are two communications, over the signature
of J.G. Freeman, proposing to controvert my positions
relative to the gamblers, and challenging me to a public
discussion.</p>

<p>This individual called upon me after the publication
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>of his first letter, and seemed to be honest in his intentions
to defend his system of untold enormities. If the
public, therefore, can be benefited, and my reformatory
purpose in this particular promoted, as I suspect it will,
I would rather court than avoid such an interview.</p>

<p>I have long wished for, but certainly never expected
such a discussion.</p>

<p>I see the shoe begins to pinch. I am glad to perceive
that those for whom it was made are beginning to feel
and cry aloud. Just as I anticipated, the <i>law</i> seems to be
the part which binds most. Men who are most without
conscience are generally most restive in view of a threatening
penitentiary.</p>

<p>I will accept the challenge to meet him on the several
points proposed in his communications. Indeed I am
happy that he has chosen his own grounds; for the best
which such opposition could select is likely in all conscience
to be bad enough.</p>

<p>Suffer me therefore to say to your correspondent that I
intend lecturing on the evenings of the 10th, 13th, and
15th of the coming month, (May,) at the Lecture-room of
the Chinese Museum, on George street; at which times I
will be very happy if he will attend and defend such positions
as are assumed in the two communications alluded to.</p>

<p>I shall require, however, that a committee of gentlemen
be chosen to control the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap i8">J. H. Green.</span></p>


<p>The Lecture-room of the Museum will, we think, be
found much too small to accommodate the audience, who
desire to be present on these interesting occasions.
Would it not be better to take the upper part of the Museum
building? It would certainly be filled.&mdash;<span class="smcap">ed</span>.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>Messrs. Editors:&mdash;There is a feature in Mr. Green's
acceptance to my challenge to meet him in debate upon
the subject of gambling, with which I frankly confess I am
not at all pleased. Upon looking over it, you will discover
that he uses the following language: "Suffer me,
therefore, to say to your correspondent, that I intend lecturing
on the evenings of the 10th, 13th, and 15th of the
coming month, (May,) at the lecture-room of the Chinese
Museum, on George street; at which time I will be very
happy if he will attend and defend such positions as are
assumed in the two communications alluded to." Now,
I should like to know Mr. Green's motive for calling a
<i>debate</i> a <i>lecture</i>? Why not call things by their right
names?</p>

<p>You will, therefore, Messrs. Editors, be pleased to inform
your correspondent, Mr. Green, that I cordially consent
to meet him at the time and place designated by
him, for the purpose of <i>debating</i> the gambling question;
and the cash which may be taken at the door to be
divided between us, if any, after all the expenses are
paid, or to be disposed of in such a manner as the committee
may deem just and proper. 'Tis true, I did say
in my first communication that I did not care to have any
of the money, and I so felt and so thought at that time;
but since, I have employed some reflection upon the subject,
and, like some of our modern politicians, I have
<i>changed</i>. 'Tis true that money is no part of the motive,
but then, as Mr. Polk once expressed himself in regard
to the tariff and protection, I am willing that it should
come in <i>incidentally</i>.</p>

<p>Now, it falls to my lot to know much more of the history
of Mr. Green than any of those who know it only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>from his own statements and publications. About four
or five years ago, in the city of New York, I became acquainted
with a gentleman by the name of Ball, a dealer
in ivory; this Mr. B. exhibited a large quantity of Mr.
Green's cheating cards, and said that Mr. Green was
largely in his debt, and that his only way to make the
debt was to sell those cards, and asked me to buy. He
then took me into another room and exhibited to me some
very costly machinery, and certainly the strangest I had
ever seen;&mdash;it had been invented by Mr. Green to put a
sign on white-back cards, so as to know them by the
backs. He also showed me other stamps invented by
Mr. Green. Now the consummation of this work had
cost Mr. Green not only much valuable time, but all the
money he could possibly borrow; but, after all, the thing
ends in disaster&mdash;the cards don't sell. Desperation seizes
upon him. Like Arnold, he now throws his eye over to
the other camp, and thinks what might be done in the
way of a reward. He consoles himself with the reflection
that he will, at least, be upon the side of virtue: "I will
tell the public that my only motive is to benefit the rising
generation, (a profitable thought with Mr. Green, 'the
rising generation'); but in order to begin right, I will
publish to the world a full history of my life, in which it
will devolve upon me to make a confession of my sins.
All, I will disclose to the world; but as to that ponderous
machinery at Mr. Ball's in New York&mdash;I rather
think I will skip that."</p>

<p>Now when poverty pinched the prodigal son, as it did
Mr. Green in New York, what was the language of that
truly penitent. Alluding to his old father, he says: "I
will go and tell <i>all</i> I ever done, &amp;c." But when Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Green resolves to put on a mask of penitence, what is his
course? I will go and tell those good ministers of the
gospel, and others, <i>half</i> I ever done, &amp;c., and then take
good care to run my hand as deep into their purses as
possible.</p>

<p>Now in Mr. Green's crusade against gambling and
gamblers, if he had shown signs of purity of motive, and
had not wantonly and knowingly misrepresented the men,
and disguised the facts in regard to the profession, I would
be the last man living to impugn him. But the motive,
I consider, was <i>corrupt</i>&mdash;'twas spoils;&mdash;and in the mode
of attack, the established principle in morals has <i>not</i> been
regarded, which is, that the means in the accomplishment
of any public good must always be as honest as the
ends; and for these reasons I do feel sanguine in the belief,
when the trial comes off at the Chinese Museum
next week, that if I do not get the verdict, I shall do
more&mdash;I shall deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Yours, &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap i8">J.G. Freeman.</span></p>


<p>N.B.&mdash;If the gentlemen, editors generally, of this
city, will give the above communication a place in their
columns, with such comments as they may think fit to
make, they will confer a favour upon one of the proscribed,
but one who suffers no man to stand in front of him as a
lover of truth.</p>

<p class="center">Communicated for the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Messrs. Barrett &amp; Jones</i>:&mdash;I had supposed that my
consent to Mr. Freeman's request to be heard in defence
of his fraternity, had fixed that issue. I did not intend
by the announcement of my lecturing on the evenings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>alluded to by Mr. F., that they were to be any thing more
than a fair discussion of the character and tendencies of
gambling, if Mr. F. should think proper to participate.
I wish it now to be so understood. I want a committee
of gentlemen to arrange this matter. But why Mr. F.
should suppose that he should have half the proceeds of
the meeting, I am unable to conjecture. He seeks an
opportunity to defend his business against attacks which
it seems has excited no small share of alarm on his part,
or those whom he represents, and yet he demands remuneration!
The fraternity must be in a rather forlorn condition
at present, if they are unable to pay their attorney,
in so philanthropic a cause. When we consider the
source, this demand sits with ill grace upon such a champion.
I have laboured now for four years, having commenced
my reform without a dollar, to expose this damnable
vice. If I am not supported by the public which
my labours are designed to benefit, those labours must necessarily
cease.</p>

<p>Were Mr. F. similarly engaged, I would share with
him not only the profits of my meetings, but my heart's
best feelings also.</p>

<p>I shall be very happy if I am met, as I was led to believe,
am no speaker, but somewhat skilful with cards, <i>and their</i>
use by me before an intelligent audience is my argument;
I want no better for my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="i8">J. H. GREEN.</span></p>


<p>Messrs. Editors:&mdash;It appears from Mr. Green's last
communication that he and I are at issue in regard to the
preliminary arrangements of the debate that is to come
off next week, upon the gambling question. He thinks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>that he ought to have all the proceeds of the meeting;
and I think it should be equally divided, or else given
to some charitable institution, or else have it free. Mr.
Green's argument for supposing that he should have <i>all</i>,
is, that because he has been labouring four years, he
ought to be rewarded: and in rather a threatening tone
gives the public to understand that if they do not reward
him he will quit. "If I am not," he says, "supported
by the public, which my labours are designed to benefit,
those labours must necessarily cease." Now, <i>my</i>
argument for supposing that the proceeds should be
equally divided is, that I claim to be the <i>real</i> reformer;
that it will be seen by those who may attend the discussion,
that it is <i>I</i> that am the true moralist&mdash;I shall go
with the New Testament in one hand, and Dr. Paley's
Moral Philosophy in the other, and upon that battery,
and no other, will I plant my artillery. He that is <i>green</i>
enough to suppose that I am green-<i>horn</i> enough to get up
before a large audience, in the enlightened city of Philadelphia,
to defend an absurdity, must be verdant indeed
I go not to defend gamblers, but to defend truth, and to
show that Mr. Green, like a corrupt witness, in his eagerness
to procure a verdict for his party, goes beyond the
facts; and that too when there is no necessity for it,
for the gambler has real sins enough without heaping
others upon him which he never committed. Now then,
to end all this difficulty at a blow, I make to Mr. Green
the proposition&mdash;That the honourable Mayor of the city,
if he will do it, be the person to appoint the committee
that is to conduct the debate, and to the decision of the
committee, as to the funds, will I cordially submit, but
not to Mr. <i>Green's ipse dixit</i>. And here I will further
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>suggest, that the committee be composed wholly of lawyers.
This will be proper, because it is a question of law
that is to be discussed; and further, it is presumed that
they understand better than any other class of men what
is called parliamentary usage.</p>

<p>Should this proposition not be acceded to, which I
<i>know</i> is fair, my course will be to debate the question on
"my own hook," and in that case take all the money and
give Mr. Green not a dollar of it, but invite him to come
to <i>my</i> quarters, and defend himself, for I shall certainly
be down upon him&mdash;and so let him go to his house the
next night and take what may be offered at his door,
and allow me to answer him in what he may have to
say.</p>

<p>When Mr. Green, in his acceptance of my challenge,
<i>would</i> call the debate a <i>lecture</i>, I saw that old habits,
that of cheating, had not yet left him. Why it looks as
though he has the unblushing impudence to attempt to
turn a Jack from the bottom, upon me, in the very blaze
of day, the very first deal; but the gentleman ought to
know that he is now in contact with one who knows how
little things are done. Yes, he would have it that the
<i>debate</i> was a lecture, and <i>Mr. Green's</i> lecture, not mine,
and why? Why because if it be his lecture, all the
cash would, as a matter of course, be his. Also, is this
not, I ask, the trick of a perfect black-leg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap i8">J.G. Freeman.</span></p>

<p class="center">First Night, from the Times.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, at the Lecture-room of the Chinese
Museum, the debate between Mr. Green, the Reformed
gambler, and Mr. J.G. Freeman of the opposite side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>took place, in the presence of a very large and highly respectable
audience, partly composed of ladies.</p>

<p>Dr. Elder, at the appointed time, announced that the
disputants were upon the ground, and prepared to enter
into the discussion of the subject of gambling. He then
introduced Mr. Freeman to the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. F. said his antagonist and himself had settled the
preliminaries, and in regard to the proceeds of the debates,
it had been agreed that Mr. Green should receive
those of the two first meetings, and that Mr. Freeman
should receive the returns of the third meeting, provided,
on motion, a large majority of those present were in favour
of it.</p>

<p>He would not attempt to disguise his real feelings from
his hearers, and the gratification he experienced in having
the opportunity of speaking, for once in his life, to
an audience composed of men of intelligence and integrity.
He well knew the difficulties under which he
laboured, being unused to speaking in public, and surrounded
as he was in the community by the reverend
gentlemen and the press, who were avowedly opposed to
him, and who had thrown their bomb-shells and Congreve
rockets liberally at the gambling fraternity, without
mercy, but he regarded these weapons as harmless, for
they had fallen at his feet without inflicting a single
wound.</p>

<p>Mr. F. then turned to the consideration of the laws
making gambling a penal offence, and particularly referred
to the act of Assembly passed by the last legislature,
which he denounced as unjust and impolitic. He
did not appear for the purpose of defending gambling,
but to speak a word in favour of those who had been re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>presented
to be the worst members of society, and against
whom the voice of proscription had been raised. He
contended that a man had a constitutional right to do
what he pleased with that which was legally his own
property, and all laws passed to abridge that right ought
to receive public reprehension.</p>

<p>He was at a loss to understand why Mr. Green should
have taken so active a part in the passage of the law at
Harrisburg. It had been said that gambling must be
checked, and in order to put it down, you must make it
a penitentiary offence. He regarded this as an egregious
error. Gambling, he was convinced, ought to be treated
in the same manner as Intemperance&mdash;by moral suasion&mdash;and
not by passing a law that puts a man in the penitentiary
for exercising a legal right. But there were
fewer gamblers than drunkards, and the former had no
influence at the ballot-box.</p>

<p>He denied the statements of Mr. Green, that young
men had been enticed to gambling-houses. They invariably
went there of their own accord, and he related instances
in which the relatives and friends of young men
were called upon by gamblers, to exercise proper authority
in restraining them from visiting such places.</p>

<p>He alluded to the excessive penalty attached to the
law, and argued that it would never be enforced, there
being no inducement for the police to detect the offenders;
and that from the face of the law is shown, that it
was not made for the punishment of wealthy gamblers,
but the poor itinerant wretches who had no local habitation.
These being birds of passage, he questioned whether
they would remain long enough in one place to be caught,
while the rich operator and speculator would be permitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>to go on unmolested, in his gilded career of depredations
upon his fellow man.</p>

<p>Mr. Green then arose and expressed his surprise that
any individual could have the effrontery to stand up before
an intelligent body of citizens, a part of that constituency,
from whom the legislature of the state had derived
its authority, and denounce a law which had not
only been passed with entire unanimity of the members
of that body, but which had met with general favour from
the people. He then referred to the act of Assembly, and
made some explanatory remarks upon it. He ably defended
the law from the remarks of his opponent, in regard
to its vagueness and insufficiency. On the whole,
he regarded it as a good one. It could be effectively put
in force, and was calculated to crush the evil of gambling.</p>

<p>He said he had no wish to conceal from the people
his former habits and mode of getting a livelihood, but on
the contrary, had repeatedly, in public, represented himself
as being a wary gambler, and acknowledged that he
had done, perhaps, as much with cards in a professional
way as any man claiming the same amount of information
in regard to them.</p>

<p>He then passed to a review of the terrible consequences
of gambling, and showed that those who became addicted
to it, acquired a passion for play, that predominated over
every other feeling, and closed up the springs of affection
and sympathy in the human heart.</p>

<p>These facts he forcibly and eloquently illustrated by
relating some painful occurrence, which came under his
observation. On one occasion he was playing with a
party, one of whom was losing his money very rapidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
In the height of a game, his family physician entered the
room, and saying that it was with much difficulty that he
found his whereabouts, informed him that his daughter
had been seized with extreme illness. The gambler replied,
that he would return to his home very soon.</p>

<p>The doctor left, but not long after returned with the
gambler's wife, who implored him to come home, as the
girl was dying. He desired the doctor to lead his wife
from the room, with the solemn promise to follow them;
which promise he seemed to have forgotten the next instant,
so deeply was he interested in the play, and he remained
at the gaming-table. In a little while after, the
doctor returned and told him his daughter was dead.
For the moment, he appeared to be greatly affected, but
he still sat at the faro table of that h&mdash;l, and when he
arose from it he was a ruined man.</p>

<p>The man has since reformed, and Mr. Green said that
when he last saw him, in Baltimore, he attempted to describe
the feelings which rent his breast, after he had realized
the sad events of that night. His first desire was to
commit suicide, but the hand of Providence stayed his
arm, and by His interposition he was enabled to turn
from the vice, and shun the society of those who practise
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Green re-asserted that all he had stated about plans
being laid to catch the unwary, by gamblers, was strictly
true. He had been cognisant of plottings of the fraternity,
and in speaking of some individual who was about
to be plucked, the common expression among them was,
"that he was not ripe yet." The remarks of Mr
Green were listened to with great attention by the audience.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Freeman followed, and after briefly replying to
the points of the previous speaker, said that it was his
intention, at the next meeting, to prove that all species
of speculation is, properly speaking, gambling.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Chambers concluded. He confessed
his disappointment. He expected to find a man here
who would attempt to defend gambling, but he congratulated
the audience that no such thing had been attempted,
Mr. Freeman having acknowledged gambling to be
an evil.</p>

<p>The Reverend gentleman's remarks were of a general
character, and in the course of their delivery he upheld
the law of the state, and unsparingly denounced those
for whose detection and punishment it was passed.</p>

<p class="center">First Night, from the Saturday Evening Post.</p>

<p>The discussion on gambling, between Mr. Green the
Reformed gambler, and Mr. Freeman, of the "Profession,"
which has been looked forward to with so much
interest, opened upon Monday evening. The audience
generally, however, were rather disappointed, inasmuch
as Mr. Freeman stated that he did not come there to defend
gambling, but only to prove the folly and injustice
of attempting to put it down by making its practice, <i>by
professional gamblers</i>, an offence punishable by imprisonment
in the penitentiary. But although Mr. Freeman
made this avowal, he evidently did attempt in various
parts of the discussion to defend gambling&mdash;not, however,
as a thing good in itself, but as being no worse than
many other practices which society tolerates, and which
no man loses his reputation, or is in danger of imprisonment,
for engaging in.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>We have no scruple in confessing, that we were much
interested in Mr. Freeman. He appears to be one of a
singular class of men, some one of whom may be found
in nearly every pursuit, however dishonourable&mdash;men
of keen and subtle minds, and of as much goodness and
honesty of purpose as is possible in the life which they
have chosen, or into which perhaps they have been in a
degree forced. In the course of his remarks, he made
one allusion to his own history, which while it told as
much as any thing that was said in the course of the debate
against gambling, opened unto us, in a degree, the
secret of his present position. He said that when he was
a young man, he had lost his all at the gaming table, and
that from that blow he had never recovered&mdash;"<i>it had
broken his heart</i>." And yet, strange anomaly, he now
not only makes his living by gambling, but stands up
before the world as its defender.</p>

<p>But let us look a little further into Mr. Freeman's arguments.
He did not state them very plainly, being evidently
unaccustomed to public speaking, and, as the
English say, to "thinking on his legs," but if we are not
mistaken, he reasons to his own heart as follows. Gambling
in cards is not right <i>abstractly</i>, but it is the same
in principle as gambling in stocks, in breadstuffs, in
merchandise, in land, or in any thing else. None of
these are right, but they are necessary fruits of the folly
and wickedness of men, and inevitable in the present
condition of society. "I make my living, I know," he
probably says, "from the weakness and wickedness of
my fellow men; but so do the physician, the judge, the
lawyer, the jailer, and the hangman." If we are not
mistaken, in this way does Mr. Freeman make out a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>clear case to his own conscience; and to some small extent
he is right in what he asserts. To gamble with
cards is the same principle as to gamble with stocks, or
any thing else&mdash;the difference is only one of degree;
but although the gambler and the judge both live, in a
certain sense, off of the vices of their fellow men, the difference
is very evident between him whose business conduces
to increase those vices, and his whose noble office
it is to lessen them.</p>

<p>But Mr. Freeman complains that, while the gambler
with cards is proscribed by society, and branded with all
marks of shame, and laws passed to imprison him if found
practising his art, the gambler in stocks is neither reviled
nor imprisoned. At the rank injustice, as he, in our
opinion, honestly believes it, of this course on the part
of society, he can hardly contain his indignation. Those
"uncouth gestures," as one of our contemporaries designates
them, were not in our opinion intended for effect,
but were the natural language of uncontrollable indignation
at what he believes to be the rank in justice of society,
which he could not adequately express in words. The
audience laughed, but the speaker was far from laughing&mdash;a
perfect tempest of conflicting emotions, it seemed
to us, was agitating his bosom. Strange as it may sound
to our readers, he evidently thought that his cause was
just, and wanted to make it appear so, not to the gamblers
and their friends, hundreds of whom were present, and
ready at any moment with their applause, but to the
crowd of intelligent, virtuous men and women, in whose
audience he stood. We saw the breaking out of this
feeling in the half-contemptuous manner in which he
alluded to the tastes of gamblers in general, as contrasted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>with his own&mdash;"he did not keep the company of gamblers;
he had nothing to say against them, but his tastes
were different."</p>

<p>But is it unjust to punish the gambler with cards by
imprisonment and public proscription, while the gambler
in stocks, &amp;c., whose crime is the same in principle,
though not in degree, goes unwhipt of justice? Undoubtedly
it is, for it is no reason that one vice should go
unpunished, because another is able to escape for the
present. Mr. Freeman's argument is very good, so far
as it applies to inflicting upon the gambler in stocks the
same penalty as on himself; but the law of Progress, and
the best interests of society, demand that these things
should never be allowed to work backwards. For the
way society advances, is simply this&mdash;the worst manifestations
of vice are first proscribed, and then their proscription
is made a stepping-stone to demolish others.
For instance&mdash;we attack gambling with cards, the worst
manifestation of the gambling principle; we make it abhorrent
to the moral sense of the world; we so confound
it, and justly too, with robbery, that future generations
shall grow up in that faith, and all the efforts of interested
sophistry never be able henceforward to separate them to
the popular apprehension. Having done this, in the
course of some fifty or one hundred years, certain dealings
in stocks, for instance, are called in question. If they
can be proved to be rightly described by the phrase
"<span class="smcap">Gambling</span> in Stocks," the battle is half-won. For the
proscription of the worst kind of gambling has given a
vantage ground from which to attack the principle of
gambling wherever found. And this, we say, is the
only law of progress.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Another ground taken by Mr. Freeman was, that "a
man has a right to do what he chooses with his own,
if in so doing he does not injure anybody else." In a
limited sense, this is true, doubtless&mdash;but he does injure
somebody else if he fails to perform his duties to his
family or to his country. For instance, he has no right to
commit suicide. But gambling cannot be done without
injuring somebody else, as it takes two to play at it&mdash;leaving
out of view the injury done to society at large, as
Mr. Green has shown in his various works on the subject.
But there is no necessity in dwelling upon this
point&mdash;it cannot be defended for a moment.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Green's part in the discussion, it is not necessary
to say much. He has our confidence and sympathy.
We consider his present course a most noble
one, and wish him all success in his efforts to overthrow
the abominable vice from whose clutches he has come
forth a reformed man.</p>

<p>We have taken up considerable room with this subject,
because we feel great interest in both parties engaged
in the discussion. Did Mr. Freeman appear to
be only a bold, bad man, we should hardly have wasted
a single paragraph upon him or his arguments. But he
is evidently a man of considerable information and talent,
and to all appearance, strange as it may sound, of much
sincerity and cross-grained honesty. That he may be
led to forsake his present pursuits, before his gray hairs
shall have gone down to a dishonoured grave, is our fervent
wish and prayer.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">From Scott's Weekly.</p>

<p>The interesting question between Mr. J. H. Green,
the Reformed Gambler, and Mr. J.G. Freeman, as to the
rights of gambling, was discussed in the Lecture-room
of the Museum Building, on Monday evening last. A
large audience attended, and notwithstanding the zeal
of Mr. Freeman more than once carried him a little beyond
the limits of propriety, the whole passed off pleasantly.</p>

<p>The announcement in the papers was not adhered to,
which created some dissatisfaction; but then the speeches
of Mr. Freeman were of themselves well worth the price
of admission. He did not defend gambling&mdash;he could
not, he said, pretend to defend it&mdash;he only meant to
deny the sweeping aspersions of its foes. He spoke at
great length, and sometimes his logic was quite ingenious.</p>

<p>Mr. Green confined himself to a few facts, leaving the
more minute part of the discussion for a subsequent evening.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Chambers closed the proceedings by a
few timely remarks, in which he reviewed what he considered
lawful and unlawful pursuits&mdash;among these latter,
he hoped to see the time that every vender of intoxicating
liquors would be placed in the same catalogue that gamblers
are by the recent law&mdash;imprisonment. He then
referred to the decorum of the audience, and expressed
a hope that all the future discussions would be listened
to in the same spirit&mdash;that all the truth possible may be
elicited in reference to that terrible vice&mdash;gambling.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">From the Inquirer.</p>

<p>The long-talked-of debate upon gambling and its tendencies,
was commenced last evening in the Lecture-room
of the Chinese Museum. The audience was large, and
deep interest was manifested in the discussion. Aboard
of highly respectable gentlemen presided as Moderators,
and Dr. Elder officiated as chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, the challenger, opened the debate, and
proposed that the question be met in a categorical form,
thus:&mdash;Were the laws of the different states which make
gambling a Penitentiary offence unjust and impolitic?
Were they formed in good policy or not?</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman considered himself as honoured in being
permitted to speak before the meeting on the question.
Fearful odds were against him; all the ranks of battle
were on the other side. The clergy, who were accustomed
to public speaking, were against him&mdash;as well as
the editors and the press. In the war now raging, the
climate&mdash;the sickly climate, was more dangerous than
the shells and shot of the enemy&mdash;and in this case, the
sickly climate was the prejudice, the prejudice of opinion,
which was against the cause he espoused, or rather
defended. Mr. F. also referred to other influences against
him. Mr. F. contended that even, if the states in which
such laws were passed, disliked the vice of gambling&mdash;
it was no reason why they should pass laws that were unjust
and impolitic.</p>

<p>Mr. F. contended, in opposition to such laws, that a
man had a perfect right to do what he pleased with his
own things. Any legislation to the contrary was tyranny.
More mischief and immorality would result from such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>laws than from the vice itself&mdash;for it was a violation of one
of the rights of man on the mere score of expediency. He
contended, therefore, that men had a perfect right to do
what they pleased with their own things, so long as they
did not interfere with the rights of others. A drunkard
could not drink without disturbing other people&mdash;why
not make his a Penitentiary offence? Yet a gambler was
considered a Penitentiary offender, though he did not interfere
with the rights of others.</p>

<p>What were speculators in railroads, &amp;c. &amp;c.?&mdash;Why
many of them gamblers on the largest scale!</p>

<p>In noticing the temptations of gambling, Mr. F. said
that he and other gamblers had often warned youths
against entering upon that dangerous course, and had
thus saved them from ruin.</p>

<p>Mr. F. argued against the law recently enacted at
Harrisburg against gambling, on the ground that it was
partial and unjust.</p>

<p>One of the strangest things was, that a man who had
been imprisoned, had been an outcast himself, should be
the first to betray, and to place others in the same situation,
and send them to the Penitentiary. Yet such was
the case with the gentleman who had come from Ohio
to Harrisburg to assist in obtaining the passage of the
law against gambling.</p>

<p>Mr. Green replied, and defended the law in question,
as it was passed in Pennsylvania; and read a section, in
which gamblers, without a fixed residence, were, upon
conviction, to be imprisoned, &amp;c.; and Mr. G. said that
although no games were mentioned, yet all gambling
games were included. Mr. G. admitted that he had
been a gambler for many years, and had done much evil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>to the community&mdash;as much as most evil men&mdash;but he
was now, he hoped, reformed. Mr. G. then contended
that several gambling-houses and tables had been closed
under this law&mdash;and surely this was a great advantage
to the public&mdash;surely such closing of gaming-houses had
saved many persons from ruin.</p>

<p>Mr. Green gave much experience of his gambling life,
and contended that principles of honour were not common
among gamblers. Gambling was a principle of robbery&mdash;of
robbery from beginning to end. If gambling
was right&mdash;why, Mr. Green would ask&mdash;did the former
speaker persuade young men not to come into gambling-houses?
Mr. Green described a splendid gambling-house
in Calvert street, Baltimore, and the snares of robbery
laid for the unwary&mdash;and the method adopted to entrap a
rich and unwary citizen. The revelations were truly
startling, and displayed a painful instance of the <i>"facilis
descensus averni"</i>&mdash;a father whose feelings were blunted,
and hardly to be re-awakened even by the death of a
beloved daughter. And this was but one instance out
of thousands, in which the sum of $1200, $1500, and
$2000 had been lost at various times, and a fatal, fascinating
infatuation contracted.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman resumed, and again contended for the
right of any man to gamble&mdash;that he had a right to do
what he would with his own&mdash;and that a law was unfair
which punished this one vice, and let other and greater
vices alone. It was cowardly legislation. A gambler
was said to have no home, and would not be missed, if he
were sent to prison; but send a man of property, of standing
to prison for some one of <i>his</i> vices, and there would
soon be a fuss in the wigwam. Mr. F. was very severe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>upon the great body of editors, for following servilely
public opinion, without courage or independence to express
a manly opinion of their own.</p>

<p>Mr. F. said that all ministers were not good men&mdash;there
were a few exceptions&mdash;neither should all gamblers,
in fairness, be considered as scoundrels. He, Mr. F. as
a gambler, never would admit his inferiority to those individuals
who, without labour, gained money and circumvented
others by extensive and fraudulent schemes of
speculation.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Chambers summed up with great eloquence
and ability, and said that he was disappointed&mdash;
he had expected a defence and vindication of gambling
as an <i>honourable</i> profession&mdash;but he was glad to
find that the gentleman who had spoken, Mr. Freeman,
had not even attempted to advocate gambling as truthful
or honest.</p>

<p>Mr. Chambers considered all dealing fair, in which a
man received a <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;but whether a man cheat
at cards or in the sale of a bale of dry goods, he was
equally a scoundrel. If Mr. Freeman would make it
appear that gambling was a fair business, he (Mr. C.)
would not wish it to be a Penitentiary offence; but if
gambling was, as Mr. Green had shown, a system of robbery&mdash;why
then, it ought to be a Penitentiary offence.
Mr. C. said that Mr. Freeman had behaved honourably&mdash;for
he had said to young men&mdash;"Do not come into
this place!" And why? Because it was the road to
ruin.</p>

<p>Mr. C. regretted that Mr. Freeman should have made
several scriptural allusions. No virtuous man would
ever support gambling&mdash;for it gave no equivalent either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>in money or reputation for the losses sustained. As such
was the case, gambling should be a Penitentiary offence&mdash;but
if Mr. Freeman could prove that it was an upright
and honourable calling, why then, perhaps, he
might induce us to apprentice our children to it.</p>

<p>After Mr. Green had spoken for a few minutes, the
debate was adjourned to Thursday evening next.</p>

<p class="center">From the Evening Bulletin.</p>

<p>The great discussion on the subject of gambling came
off last night at the Chinese Museum, between Mr. Green,
the celebrated Reformed Gambler, and Mr. Freeman, the
individual who acknowledges himself one of the "sporting"
band. The audience was very large and respectable.
A board of worthy gentlemen were appointed a governing
committee, of which Dr. Elder acted as chairman. The
whole proceedings were marked with the greatest decorum.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman spoke first. He is a man somewhat
advanced in years, and possesses abilities, which we could
wish were better applied than in the defence, or even palliation,
of such a corrupting habit as gambling. He directed
his batteries mainly against the late gambling
laws in this state.</p>

<p>He did not like the application to professional and not
private gambling. He denounced editors and ministers
by wholesale; in regard to the former, declaring that
there was only one in the country who was really independent,
and that one, Bennett of the New York Herald!
He quoted Scripture, but that is not surprising, for we
are told by the poet, "the devil may cite Scripture." His
manner was violent, and his allusions to his opponent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Mr. Green, the very essence of bitterness. He tried to
slide his repugnance to that gentleman into the small
corner of contempt; but the whole audience could see
that he, in reality, entertained no such trifling feelings
towards his opponent.</p>

<p>Mr. Green spoke in reply to Freeman, not only like a
gentleman, but like a Christian. He treated the sneers
of his opponent with kindness, seeming to be sorry, if
one might judge from his manner, that he should have
boldly placed himself in the point which he occupies
before the community. There was a plain, straightforward
honesty, as well as a gentleness in the tone and
manner of Green, which, though he did not indulge in
such a flow of language as his opponent, spoke volumes
in favour of his sincerity, and won for him new friends
and admirers. His opponent had intimated both by
word and act, that he was not to be trusted; he did not
seem to feel it necessary to go into a defence of his motives
in reply, but appeared to say, "Here I am,&mdash;I come
to denounce a habit of pestiferous corrupting influence,
of which I have practical knowledge; I will stand or
fall by the position which I have taken,&mdash;leaving the
future to show the world whether or not I am honest."
Freeman spoke again after Green concluded, and very
much in the same style as in the early part of the evening.</p>

<p>After he had concluded, the Rev. John Chambers made
an address, which was marked with strong argument
and a fine Christian-like tone. Mr. Green then said a
few words, and the meeting adjourned to Thursday evening,
at the same place, when the discussion is to be resumed.
There doubtless will be a large attendance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
No subject could be more interesting to the public,
and the agitation of none can exercise a better moral
influence.</p>

<p class="center">From the North American.</p>

<p>A good-humoured illustration of the right of every
one to say what he pleases, took place at the Lecture-room
of the Museum last evening. Mr. Freeman, an
uncouth man, who gesticulates as if he was mending
shoes, but who has naturally no inconsiderable endowment
of brain and nerve, delivered himself of a tirade
against everybody in general, and against the press and
clergy in particular. He complained that everybody was
against him&mdash;compared the clergy to Gen. Scott and his
regulars; the editors to bomb-shells and Congreve rockets,
and what else we know not; himself individually to
Gen. Taylor, and the race of the poor persecuted gamblers
to our Saviour&mdash;who, he said, like them, had not
where to lay his head!</p>

<p>The impious jumble of fustian and blasphemy was
accompanied in the delivery by every species of grimace
and buffoonery, and a fierceness of dramatic action and
posture far more ludicrously affecting than the classic
attitudes of Gen. Tom Thumb, who was defying the
lightning, as Ajax, dying like the Gladiator, and taking
snuff like Napoleon, in the room overhead. At the bottom
of all this ridiculous exhibition, which drew repeated
shouts of laughter from the very large and respectable
audience, lay two principles upon which Mr. Freeman
might have erected an imposing argumentative structure.
These were, that every man has a right to do what he
pleases with his own, so that he does not disturb others;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>and that laws punishing professional gamblers and letting
citizens go free, are unjust.</p>

<p>Mr. Green, without going into the metaphysics of
the question, showed by some very plain and straightforward
remarks the fraud and villany of professional
gambling, and proved that it was throughout a <i>system</i>
of deliberate robbery. This being the case, it follows,
of course, that the general good of the community, which
has ever been acknowledged paramount, requires it to be
put down. Thus satisfactorily stood the question when
we left, and we do not see how it can fairly be removed
from this broad ground. It is evident that Mr. Green is
a sincere man, and we firmly believe that he is engaged
in a good work.</p>


<p class="center">SECOND NIGHT.</p>

<p class="center">From the Inquirer.</p>

<p>The discussion between Mr. Green, the Reformed gambler,
and Mr. Freeman in opposition, was continued yesterday
evening, in the Lecture-room of the Chinese
Museum, Leonard Jewell, Esq. in the chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman contended that not one of his arguments,
on the previous evening, had been answered by Mr.
Green, but anecdotes and doleful stories had been told
instead. Mr. F. defended his allusions from Scripture,
and said that they had been misconstrued; that he only
meant to say that the Saviour of mankind had recommended
us to do good, and to return good for evil; but
some of the clergy had not followed the golden rule in
this matter, for punishment and the Penitentiary had
been recommended by them as a cure for gambling. As
it was known that he (the speaker) played, he came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>only to defend gambling as far as truth went, but no
farther&mdash;there he would stop.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman complained that Mr. Green had classed <i>all</i>
gamblers as men of the worst character&mdash;as if they were
thieves or counterfeiters, whereas Mr. G. knew that he
could mention many who were incapable of doing any
thing mean&mdash;men who would denounce a counterfeiter as
soon as any one in that room. Mr. Freeman related a
story of a fraudulent trick, by which a large sum of
money had been fraudulently obtained, and its recovery
prevented by force&mdash;one individual, who was named,
menacing with a bowie-knife; and Mr. F. said of the
getter-up of the plan&mdash;pointing to Mr. Green&mdash;"as Nathan
said unto David, there sits the man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Green admitted that it might be so&mdash;that it
was so.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman said that he knew Mr. Green's friends
had a reply to cover all such things&mdash;because he was a
reformed man&mdash;Mr. F. hoped it was so, but he really
had some little doubt.</p>

<p>Mr. F. distinguished between deep play, which he
likened to the <i>strategie</i> of generals in the field, the one
to mislead the other, and open, undisguised cheating,
which he denounced. Mr. F. referred to several distinguished
men who gambled&mdash;and to several well-known
gamblers&mdash;and he defied Mr. Green to say that
any one he had named would or could be guilty of a
mean action.</p>

<p>There was in the world a certain amount of wealth&mdash;the
many of mankind were (the industrious) producers&mdash;but
he held that all men, speculators, who circumvented
others by their wits, living without work, were in point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>of fact&mdash;<i>gamblers</i>. If a man were to go into the street
and gain $3000 in a morning by a stock or other speculation&mdash;why,
as surely as we lived, somebody lost that
money&mdash;aye, and by gambling on the largest scale. Men
who lost their money at a gaming-table went there to
win money of the gamblers&mdash;but generally lost their own.
Their object was to put the gambler's money in their
own pockets; and when they were disappointed, they
exclaimed against gamblers. Gamblers lived on the depravity
of men; if men were not depraved, gamblers
would have no chance; but they were encouraged by
the depravity of others. Mr. F. condemned and would
punish cheating, whether by gamblers or other speculators.</p>

<p>Mr. Green did not wish to say any thing personally
against any of the men or gamblers who had been named
by Mr. F. Some were benevolent men&mdash;but one or two
he had named were men without heart. He (Mr. G.)
knew several gamblers, amateurs and professional men,
who were straightforward in their gambling transactions.
He did not desire to hurt the feelings of any of these individuals&mdash;he
attacked not men but vice&mdash;and he contended
that gambling was a system of robbery, from beginning
to end. That it was that he contended for&mdash;and
that, he hoped, he had already shown. Mr. Green admitted
that Mr. Freeman's story of the scheme gotten up,
bowie-knife, &amp;c., was in the main correct. If meeting
contracts was honest&mdash;why then, many gamblers might
be called honest. He did not mean to say that such
<span class="smcap">honest</span> gamblers would put their hands in a man's
pocket and steal money&mdash;no&mdash;they would not do
that.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>But he would say what they would do;&mdash;they would
sit up all night, have suppers, wine and spirits set out to
tempt men, and they would play with any that came;
and though some such customers were known or suspected
to have obtained the money they played with by
robbery, yet he never knew that the gamblers had ever
refused to allow such men to play, so long as they had
money. Mr. Green described several snares that were
practised by gamblers, particularly one at New Orleans,
called the "broker." He hoped some of the gamblers
of this city would reform as soon as the new law went
into effect. He had already heard of some having turned
collectors, policemen, &amp;c.&mdash;but he doubted their reform
if they were turned over to the police&mdash;for though there
were some very good policemen in this city, he could
confidently say also there were some spotted ones.</p>

<p>Mr. Green considered the bowling-alleys and billiard
rooms as the very bane of the city&mdash;leading men on step
by step to the vices of gambling and drunkenness. Mr.
Green stated that he had never met with a gambler
in his life, who played honestly, and got his living by
playing cards honestly&mdash;for all he had ever known
would take advantage, sometimes&mdash;which perhaps the
world might call cheating. Mr. Green practically illustrated
with a pack of cards the modes of taking advantage,
(cheating in plain English,) that were truly surprising.
Mr. G. said that such things were done by gamblers,
called <i>honourable</i>, and if any one had charged such men
with dishonesty, why a duel, or worse, might have been
the consequence.</p>

<p>On one occasion, he (Mr. Green) had been cheated out
of several hundred dollars by a brother gambler. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>knew it, but lost his money and said nothing&mdash;at length,
he found out the method of cheating&mdash;and went home
and set up all night by way of studying a cheat that
would recover his money and more. He succeeded at
last, and went and won all the money of his antagonist
and party&mdash;in fact, he won enough to break the whole
party. Mr. Green then showed by cards how he had
been engaged in winning (by tricks) money from a planter
in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman replied, and contended that Mr. Green
had referred to only a few mean gamblers&mdash;and by his
inference charged their practices upon the whole body.
But our limited space warns us to be brief. Mr. Freeman
only contended that a gambler was honest in a relative
point of view&mdash;as honest as other men who in
trade or otherwise, or in speculation, did things as bad
or worse than gamblers. Mr. F. related anecdotes to
show that persons charged with faults and crimes were
almost always condemned by public opinion, and their
faults and crimes exaggerated. Mr. F. stated that in
former times, the keepers of gaming-houses in New Orleans
paid heavy licenses, and were subject to ruinous
fines if they cheated in the smallest degree.</p>

<p>Mr. F. contended that cheating at cards was decidedly
a disadvantage to the gambler&mdash;because, if he lost his
character as a fair man, people would not play with
him, and so cheating was to him a loss: on the principle
of a man in England, who said he would give a hundred
thousand dollars for a character. "Why?" asked his
friends. "Because," replied the first, "because I could
gain two hundred thousand dollars by it!"</p>

<p>Mr. F. introduced several anecdotes. Mr. F. had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>heard several sensible men in New Orleans say, that if
gaming-houses there were licensed, there would be little
or no cheating, because those houses would be under the
police, and people could not then do as they now do in
holes and corners. On the principle of "Vice is a creature
of such hateful mien," &amp;c. &amp;c., Mr. F. thought that
Mr. Green, by showing and explaining some of his tricks,
would be likely to tempt some persons to practise such
tricks, if they wanted a little money; and on this point
he would quote Scripture, and say&mdash;"Lead us not into
temptation!"</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman exhibited a capital trick on the cards,
quite equal to some of Mr. Green's. But, said Mr. F., all
such things were nothing&mdash;for, in gambling, playing on
the square with fairness is the best policy. [Mr. Green
admitted Mr. Freeman's trick to be very superior&mdash;and
it was at length understood that at the next meeting (on
Saturday night) several of these mysteries would be
shown on both sides.]</p>

<p>Mr. Green declared that he could show the principle
of gambling to be a hundred per cent. worse than stealing.</p>

<p>The debate was listened to with much interest, and
we learn that it will be closed to-morrow (Saturday) evening.</p>

<p class="center">From the Evening Bulletin.</p>

<p>Messrs. Green and Freeman renewed their discussion
last night, at the Chinese Museum, in the presence of a
crowded audience, Leonard Jewell, Esq. in the chair.
Mr. Freeman spoke first, and very <i>modestly</i> contended
that none of his arguments of the previous evening had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>been answered by his opponent, but that, instead of this,
painful anecdotes and stories had been told. He had
quoted Scripture only to show that making stringent laws
to punish gambling was contrary to the spirit of our Saviour's
teaching, viz. to return good for evil. This argument,
will, of course, apply to all laws for the punishment
of crime. Freeman went on to except to Green's
wholesale denunciations of all gamblers; it was well
known that some were <i>honourable</i> men. There were a
few bad ones, his opponent knew, and one, in particular,
who on a certain occasion drew a bowie-knife to prevent
a sum of money, fraudulently obtained, being returned to
its proper owner. Green acknowledged that he was the
man to whom Freeman alluded. He would not deny that
he had been as guilty as the guiltiest.</p>

<p>Freeman continued by saying that he supposed his
opponent would get over this by saying he had reformed.
Green looked assent.</p>

<p>Freeman justified gambling by business operations,
which were the result of chance, such as stock-jobbing;
but we confess we cannot see where the parallel begins,
the one being a clear matter of chance on both sides, the
other, if Green's stories be true, which we firmly believe,
all on the side of the gambler, who cheats from the beginning
to the ending of his playing, what with tricks of
the trade, marked cards, &amp;c. Freeman took the ground
that gamblers were honest, and thus made out a better
case than the facts will sustain.</p>

<p>Mr. Green's reply was quiet and unaffected. He knew
some gamblers who were straightforward and honourable
in their playing. But the majority of the profession were
dishonest, and the community was demoralized and im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>poverished
by them. He admitted the story about the
bowie-knife. He had never been disposed to conceal any
of his wicked acts while one of the <i>profession</i>. There
was one point on which all gamblers were unprincipled;
they would play and win money of men they knew were
totally ignorant of the arts of card-playing. This was a
fraud&mdash;it was dishonest; a strong argument against the
whole band, good or bad.</p>

<p>Mr. Green denounced bowling-alleys and billiard
saloons. He then exposed the tricks by which gamblers
cheated, and in doing so interested the audience very
much.</p>

<p>Freeman's rejoinder was still to the end that some
gamblers were honest and honourable. He knew that
there were rogues among gamblers, who practised tricks,
and he gave an excellent specimen of their adroitness, in
a trick which Mr. Green acknowledged was a capital one.</p>

<p>The debate was listened to throughout with great
attention. It will be resumed on Saturday evening.</p>


<p class="center">THIRD NIGHT</p>

<p class="center">From the Daily Sun.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, the debate between Messrs. Green
and Freeman, on the subject of gambling, was resumed,
in the Lecture-room of the Museum building. There
was a full audience in attendance, and towards the close
of the debate, the proceedings became intensely interesting.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, Dr. Elder, the moderator, made
a few remarks, by way of opening the meeting, and introduced</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, who, upon advancing to the table, said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>that he regarded it as complimentary indeed, that he was
permitted to proceed with the discussion. Under all the
circumstances, he considered it a great compliment, that
a highly intelligent audience should listen to one of the
proscribed fraternity. But friends, (said the speaker,) if
the scene of the discussion lay farther South, in the region
of the spot where he was born, he would not consider
it so much of a compliment&mdash;he would not make
such a concession, even from the great Harry of the West
down to my fallen foe. In looking round the staging he observed
new faces, and missed those who had previously occupied
their places&mdash;he had heard those men had consulted
their dignity, and any man (in the opinion of the speaker)
who thinks more of his dignity than his duty is not fit to
occupy the sacred desk. The arguments which he had
brought forward on the previous occasions have not been
answered. Mr. Green has not even attempted to do so,
but he (the speaker) had found that a worthy gentleman
had entered the field, though not verbally, and endeavoured
to supply the place of his opponent. He would
take the liberty to compliment him&mdash;the distinguished
editor of the Post&mdash;though he did not know him, nor that
such a paper as the Post was printed. That editor, like
many others whose prejudices overbalance their reason,
had misunderstood him. The speaker then indulged in
a <i>critique</i> on the editorial, principally upon the ground
which he had taken&mdash;that a man has a right to do with
his own things what he pleases, provided, in so doing,
he does not infringe upon the rights of others. On this
point, it appeared that the editor thought and argued differently,
and Mr. Freeman said, that in taking the above
ground, he did not claim originality, for it is a principle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>of law, as laid down in Blackstone, Paley, and others&mdash;it
is the language of great commentators, and upon it he
would stand or fall, and leave the distinguished editor to
battle with those men.</p>

<p>Some things, continued the speaker, may seem inconsistent
at first, which, upon examination, are not inconsistent.
A thing may be legally right and morally wrong, and
whilst he could defend it legally, he could not morally.
For instance, suppose a rich man had two sons, both of
whom acted as sons should act, and the father in making
out his will should devise his whole estate to one son,
and cut the other off, as they say in England, with a
shilling. Now, who would deny his right to do so if it
pleased him; who would say that it is not legally right?&mdash;no
one. But would it be morally right?&mdash;certainly not.
What is morality?&mdash;love your God, your neighbour, and
yourself. And though he could defend the will as legal,
yet in a moral point of view he could condemn it as unnatural.
The editor of the Post (said the speaker) confounds
gambling with robbery, and what for?&mdash;that future
generations may grow up in faith. It is, said he, a settled
principle of morality never to hoist false colours, but
to raise the standard of truth and defend it to the last.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>He remembered an anecdote: a physician was sent
to attend a poor sick boy, and when he arrived at the
couch of pain and distress, he found it necessary to administer
a pill&mdash;a very nauseous dose. Said the mother&mdash;"Doctor,
it would be better to put a little sugar on it,
and then he can take it, and not know it's a pill." "No,
madam," replied the doctor, "it won't do to deceive him.
Here, my son," said the practitioner, "take this medicine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>and it will cure you," and the little fellow swallowed it
like a man. Thus it is with Mr. Green and the green
editor; they associate the gambler, without distinction,
with assassins and robbers. In doing so they are wrong;
they do not speak the truth. The speaker then proceeded
to show how a young man may often be lured into temptation&mdash;by
representing gamblers as assassins, who,
upon acquaintance, he finds are apparently gentlemen,
and he is induced to think that he has been hitherto
misled and deceived in regard to such men. He then
cultivates their acquaintance, and finally, through his
own depravity, he becomes worse and worse, until he is
at last swallowed up in the vortex of degradation. This
is the result of employing dishonourable measures to prevent
him from visiting such places, or to carry out honourable
ends.</p>

<p>A man has a right to commit suicide, so far as propriety
is concerned. If he does not owe any thing, and
feels it in his conscience that he would like to die, he
has a right to do so&mdash;but if that man owes five dollars, he
would certainly violate a moral principle by killing himself,
because he ought to live as long as he can to pay
his debt. The speaker once knew a man, in good circumstances,
who was weary of existence, and feeling disposed
to take a journey to "that bourne whence no traveller
returns," committed suicide. There may be many
who would call it murder&mdash;but the community are murderers&mdash;they
sometimes murder in cold blood. But lately
a man was taken to the gallows, and they hung a young
man because he had killed somebody else, and yet there
are many persons who believe this is right, and that
suicide, such as the speaker had selected, is wrong.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The speaker now proceeded to criticize the law relative
to gambling, passed at the recent legislature, in
which he said that if a man has a fixed place of residence
and carries on a dry goods business, he might gamble as
much as should please him and the law would not take
hold of him. He would ask anybody to read the law
understandingly and then deny this round assertion. This
act, said he, is bugbear&mdash;it is a disgrace as it now stands,
for it smacks of cowardice. The legislators, he presumed,
had a little sense, and they knew that some kind of a
law must be passed, and they were ingenious enough to
know how to frame it to sound well, and yet be comparatively
powerless. They knew by such a statute that
<i>nolle prosequis</i> could be entered&mdash;and solicitors make more
money&mdash;they well knew that there were many religious
people among their constituents, and it would not do for
them to act singular, or else they would find so short an
account at the next ballot-box that they would not be sent
back. He would spurn such legislators and keep them
for ever in private life. (Applause.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, he said that he was decidedly an anti-gambler,
and he did not defend the subject morally. In
order that he might enlighten the people on the subject
of gambling, he would give one lecture, in which he
would relate his experience, and promised that it should
be the richest and most interesting thing that could be
listened to. He did not want money. He would only
ask enough to pay expenses of the room&mdash;the ladies and
the reverend clergy may come in gratis&mdash;all he wished
was that the truth should be told about gambling.</p>

<p>Mr. Green now took the stand, and said that it appeared
to him that there was something in the law which seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>to stick to his opponent, Mr. Freeman. He complains
that the Jaw is dull&mdash;that it is trash&mdash;a bugbear, and
heaps other similar epithets upon it, and yet he appears
to make considerable noise about it, and why should he
attempt to ridicule me, in connection with the law. Every
man in this state knows that Mr. Green himself could
not pass the law without the aid of the legislature.
He (Mr. Freeman) goes on to take many other positions
which he (the speaker) could not understand, and therefore
would not further allude to them. He thought that
if the young men were warned properly to keep aloof
from the gambling shops, and they should heed the warning,
they would escape a life of infamy. 'Tis true, a
young man may go from the parlour to a gambling-place.
He will first find the gamblers fascinating&mdash;rooms handsomely
furnished&mdash;fine suppers given, and in fact, every
temptation may be set out to catch the unwary novice.
The gambler will tell him this reform is all priestcraft&mdash;you
can see for yourself that we (gamblers) are not the
assassins which we are represented to be&mdash;these reformers
don't speak the truth. The young man is blinded&mdash;he
thinks he knows by this time all about the gamblers&mdash;but
in fact he knows nothing. He goes on by degrees, until
becoming more hardened, he does not fear to do that
which would have made him recoil with horror, in the
outset. He may go to another city&mdash;carry letters of introduction
to prominent gamblers&mdash;forty other letters
may get there before him, putting the robbers on the
look out, getting them to set their stool-pigeons. The
young man is trapped&mdash;he is enticed into a gambling
hell&mdash;don't call them sporting saloons or gambling-rooms,
(said the speaker,) but call them what they are, <i>hells</i>&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>loses all his money&mdash;his character is gone&mdash;he is ruined,
and who then cares for him&mdash;does the gambler?</p>

<p>Let me relate an instance which came under my immediate
notice:&mdash;A young man in Baltimore, sometime
after he had been ruined at a gambling hell, went there,
but having no money, was not cared for by the gambler.
He laid down on the floor in a corner of the room, night
after night. One day, in particular, it was asked who he
was. "Only a loafer," replied the gambler. The young
man was aroused from his stupor by the one with whom
he had gambled and lost, and was told to go about his
business. The young man replied, "Sir, you should be
the last man to treat me so; it was with you I first played
cards, it was under your roof where I tasted the first glass
of wine;" and whilst thus expostulating, the gambler
pushed him out, he reeled down the stairs, fractured his
skull on the curb-stone and fell into the gutter. Mr.
Green was present and saw this base transaction. He
raised the young man from the gutter, gave him a handkerchief
to wipe the blood from his forehead. The next
day that young man was found dead under one of the
wharves. Now he, Mr. Green, could not say that the
gambler murdered him, but he was dead and held the
handkerchief in his clenched fist. That young man had
swallowed the wrong pill; why did not the gamblers tell
him they were robbers and assassins, why did they not
stick to the truth. They dare not do it, and he (Mr. Green)
thought it his duty as a reformed man to speak truly and
act honestly. The present law which so much troubles
Mr. Freeman was passed with due deliberation unanimously,
and when it goes into effect on the first of July
he would not wonder if there should be a very great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>amount of trouble among more gamblers than Mr. Freeman.
(Applause.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Freeman.</i> The gentleman wants to know, why
this law grieves me so&mdash;why! because it is trash. He
(the speaker) did not expect to live in Pennsylvania but a
few days longer, as he intended going South, and if he
should chance to come back again, and choose to play a
game of cards, he did not wish to be placed on a par with
incendiaries, robbers and murderers. All of you, no doubt,
have heard of steamboat racing, boilers blowing up, &amp;c.&mdash;everybody
is up in arms about it, and cry aloud for a
law to stop this abominable racing. Now he (the speaker)
could make the round statement that there never has been
one explosion of a boiler during the time of a steamboat
racing. The reason is plain. When the race is going
on, everybody is wide awake, the water is kept high, and
the boilers prevented from being overheated, and in such
a case no explosion can possibly take place. A law,
therefore, passed to stop steamboats racing in order to
prevent boilers from bursting, would be equivalent to the
law passed relative to gambling. In conclusion, he would
say that he knew of but one gambler who had been in
prison, and not one south of Mason and Dixon's line,
which was more than could be said of any other profession.
(Great applause.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Green</i> (quickly.) Why is it so?&mdash;because the gamblers
are eelish, and not because they don't deserve the
penitentiary; Mr. Freeman knows that. (Roars of laughter
and continued applause.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Elder.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, it is now proposed
that a vote be taken on the distribution of the proceeds
of this evening. Mr. Green has had the receipts of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>two previous evenings, and at the first meeting it was
agreed to let the audience decide as to the third meeting.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Were not the lectures given by Mr. Green?</p>

<p><i>Many Voices.</i> Question, question, question.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> I demand an answer to my question, for I wish
to vote understandingly.</p>

<p><i>Voices.</i> Calling question from all parts of the room.</p>

<p><i>Another Voice.</i> Mr. Speaker, I wish to know one
thing. Mr. Green says, since his reformation, he has
given back over twenty thousand dollars of property
which he won when he was a gambler. Now
I wish to know if he will give the proceeds of the
night to the gamblers, if the question is decided in his
favour.</p>

<p><i>Voices.</i> Question, take the question; loud talking and
grumbling.</p>

<p><i>First Voice.</i> Suppose it is decided in favour of Mr.
Freeman, I wish to know if the debate can be continued
or not.</p>

<p>The question was now taken by rising, and silence
being restored, the Moderator said&mdash;"It is the decision
of the chair, that the proceeds belong to Mr. Freeman, by
a very large majority."</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Sir, there is a mistake.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Are there any gentlemen here who are dissatisfied
with the decision?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> I am.</p>

<p>Hon. Charles Gibbons, speaker of the Senate, proposed
to take the question by voice. This was agreed
upon.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Elder.</i> All in favour of the proceeds being given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>to Mr. Freeman, say I. Here there was a tremendous
response. The contrary opinion was then taken, and the
chair decided that the I's were in a large majority. (Great
applause.)</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Mr. President, I demand back my quarter dollar&mdash;I
can't pay money to go into the pockets of a gambler.
(Hisses.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. Freeman.</i> The gentleman can have his quarter
back with pleasure. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was consumed in the explanation
of tricks of gamblers by Mr. Green, which was intensely
interesting, and he was greeted with rounds of
applause, as he successfully performed them.</p>

<p class="center">From the City Bulletin.</p>

<p>A large audience assembled on Saturday night to listen
to the last debate on gambling. Mr. Freeman opened
the ball with a great deal of self-possession, and talked
away in defence of a palpable wrong, with as much coolness
and composure as if he was discussing the last news
by the steamer. But his sophistry, as well as all the
sneers and jeers of his brethren in the audience, which
betrayed themselves when Green began to speak, could
not keep the truth under. Before the evening closed, he
had every thing his own way, and was complete master
of the field. Freeman battled against the late law passed
in this State&mdash;and contended that it was of no avail in
crushing the evil of gambling. He added that if it was
effective, it was effective against the wrong persons.
He then slurred over his opponent's position, charged
him with insincerity, and denounced all his tales of horror.
He incidentally, however, took occasion to say, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>he could a tale unfold which would harrow up the soul,
a tale of his own personal adventure, as a gambler,
and he invited the audience to its recital to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Green rose with the same pleasant smile which he
always has worn during his debate with Freeman, and
met his opponent's positions, not with smooth, oily, plausible
words, but in a plain spoken, substantial, truth-telling
language. He reiterated all that he had charged against
gambling at former meetings. He said gamblers were
no better than thieves, that they cheated always when
they could, and that they had every advantage over those
who fell into their clutches.</p>

<p>The audience were now called upon to vote as to the
disposal of the receipts at the door&mdash;Mr. Green having
agreed that his opponent should have them, if it was so
decided. The vote was taken, and by a large majority
the receipts were awarded to Freeman.</p>

<p>The tricks now came on, Freeman having taken the
ground that they could not be done without detection with
any cards. He accordingly placed upon the table a pack
of cards which he said he had purchased that evening.
Mr. Green in taking the cards asked that a committee
should be appointed to witness his tricks, and report to
the assembly, but Freeman and his friends put in a decided
objection to this. Green at once told the audience
he would gratify them and perform the tricks openly.
Here came his triumph, which was complete. He took
the very cards which his opponent had bought, and with
them showed conclusively, that all he had charged in relation
to the expertness and skill of gamblers, and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>course, their immense advantages over their opponents,
was true.</p>

<p>Thus has ended a debate which, we do think, has been
productive of good to the community, while it has vindicated
most fully the position which Green takes in his
work of reform. We have no sympathy for Freeman,
while he maintains his present stand, though we freely
confess he is a gentleman of ability, and that we should
be most happy to see him a co-labourer with Green, in
crushing the vice of gambling. He says he is broken
down in health and spirits. We know of nothing which
can restore the last, and make him bear the first with
greater resignation, than retire to the path of virtue.</p>

<p class="center">From the North American.</p>

<p>The gambling discussion between Messrs. Green and
Freeman was closed on Saturday evening, before a very
large and interested audience. After some speaking on
either side, which was listened to with becoming patience
and attention, the tricks&mdash;which were evidently the great
point of interest&mdash;were in order, and Mr. Green proceeded
to fulfil his promises to the letter. Mr. Freeman had
brought a pack of cards of his own selection and preparation,
and Mr. Green objected that this could hardly be
considered fair, and said that he should prefer the appointment
of a committee to provide cards, and superintend
the experiments. Upon this Mr. Freeman commenced
declaiming in a triumphant tone against his antagonist;
but Mr. Green cut him short by stating that he was willing
to proceed with the cards that Mr. Freeman had
brought. Mr. Gibbons then took the pack and marked it
with a pencil, so that he might be sure of recognising it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Mr. Green then took them from him, shuffled them a
moment with his hands under the table, and showed them
to Mr. Gibbons, who pronounced them the same he had
marked. Mr. Green then dealt them in separate heaps,
and Mr. Gibbons turned up the faces, and showed the
audience that each of the thirteen heaps contained the
four aces, four kings, four queens, and so on down to the
four deuces. The cards were then shuffled, and Mr.
Green ran them off, the backs being upward, so rapidly
that the eye could scarcely follow the motion of his fingers&mdash;naming
each card as he threw it off, and making
but <i>one</i> mistake in the whole fifty-two cards. This extraordinary
feat was received by the audience with acclamations,
as being most convincing proof of the power
of gamblers to perform the swindling deceptions with the
cards, that Mr. Green has charged upon the nimble-fingered
fraternity. The audience then good-naturedly
voted Mr. Freeman the pecuniary proceeds of the evening,
as a remuneration for the zeal he had displayed in a
bad cause. The question was then put to the audience
whether Mr. Green had satisfactorily performed all
he had undertaken, and loudly answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="center">From the United States Gazette.</p>

<p>The discussion on this important subject was continued
and concluded, on Saturday evening, by Messrs. Green
and Freeman.</p>

<p>A man who can for a few minutes interest an audience
so much in favour of the vice of gambling, as to make
them shut out its horrible deformity, must possess more
than ordinary powers, and we question much whether,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>of the whole fraternity of gamblers, one could be found
better adapted for the Herculean task which Mr. Freeman
set himself. That which the mind is accustomed steadily
to dwell upon, and upon which action is had repeatedly,
will scarcely want for self-justification&mdash;and while the
error of proceeding is reluctantly admitted, whatever may
tend to justify, however slightly, is eagerly seized upon
and proclaimed. There is scarcely an evil practice for
which the doer may not raise up or create reasons in justification,
and plausible arguments may be made to gloss
over the most detestable and indefensible crimes.</p>

<p>A kind of Letheon is administered to the judgment by
continual progression in some improper path, till that
which is to all others palpably and painfully degrading
becomes pleasant and eminently proper in him who
labours under the mental oblivion. Such a course Mr.
Freeman has trod, for while he admits that gambling is
pernicious, he clamours for the natural right which all
men possess, to do it so long as they do not meddle with
others, and insists that it in no way gives occasion for the
exercise of legal power by the fact that he has played at
cards, and lost or won money. If it could be confined to
individuals&mdash;if the penalty of the crime was visited only
upon the doer&mdash;- if the moral and pecuniary destruction
which gambling visits upon all who offer tribute at its
altar, went no farther than him who made the offering,
then Mr. Freeman would have a proper privilege, and
would be right in saying that a man violated no law by
the practice of the nefarious profession. But there are
few, very few, we suppose, who are not connected by the
ties of blood, the bonds of matrimony, or the relation of
father to child, who are all affected by such degradation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>as the gambler visits upon himself, and who feel the
bitter poignancy of the stroke with greater force than he
whose heart has been gradually but surely abased. While
a man has a single relation or friend, he should not gamble;
and if he stood alone in the world, with no friend,
the fear of the eternal judgment should deter him from
the commission of the sin.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman is a plausible man; he talks earnestly
and fluently, and his argument is clear and comprehensive,
so far as it goes. He thinks readily and speaks
aptly. As a debater, he far excels his opponent Mr.
Green, and with a good cause would be an opponent
difficult to conquer. But few, we think, expected so
much of the metaphysics of gambling as he gave, but
after he had constructed his argument, and presented the
justification of the fraternity, it was marvellous how quickly
the one crumbled and the other was turned to condemnation,
by the application of the tests of reason and truth
which Mr. Green applied. Facts stood stubbornly before
Mr. Freeman's theories, and bore them down, and
the experiments with the cards which closed the lecture,
demonstrated, beyond a doubt, how far an unscrupulous
gambler could carry his villany against an unsuspecting
victim. With a rapidity that defied observation and detection,
Mr. Green performed several tricks, by which he
produced any card or series of cards at will, and even
read eighteen cards in succession by the backs.</p>

<p>In his argument, Mr. Freeman invariably rose in the
estimation of the audience, but he rose only to fall again.
There may have been respect for his abilities, but there
was greater sorrow that so unprofitable and degrading a
direction had been given to them. Every argument that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>he used became, upon reflection, an argument against
gambling, and the only thing he really effected, was the
proof that the law recently passed against gamblers by
the legislature of this State is not stringent enough.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman announced that on Wednesday next, he
would deliver a lecture, in which he would review his
course of life, and offer arguments against gambling&mdash;which
he freely confessed to be a vice, even while he
proclaimed his right to practise it. Such an exposition
cannot fail to be of deep interest.</p>

<p class="center">From the Inquirer.</p>

<p>This controversy was continued on Saturday evening,
Dr. Elder in the chair. The Lecture-room at the Chinese
Museum was crowded on the occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman commented on the notice taken by the
press of the controversy&mdash;in general it was manly and
dignified; Mr. Freeman read from the Post, in which
gambling was severely opposed. The ground on which
Mr. Freeman had canvassed this matter was, he contended,
in accordance with Blackstone, Paley, and other
great men, who thought&mdash;namely, that a man had a right
to do what he liked with his own things. Mr. Freeman
held that a thing might be legally right and morally
wrong. A man had a legal right (he contended) to gamble&mdash;but
in a moral light he would not defend it. Suppose
a man had two sons, and, from some trivial cause,
he resolved to cut off one of them with a shilling. He
had a legal right so to do&mdash;but perhaps he was morally
wrong. Mr. Freeman answered an article that had appeared
in the Post. Mr. Freeman contended that young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>men who engaged in gambling, did so generally from a
bad system of education.</p>

<p>The Post had contended, in opposition to Mr. Freeman's
maxim that a man had a right to do what he
pleased with his own things, so long as he did not interfere
with others, that gambling did interfere with the
rights of others; for example, it might prevent men
from paying their debts, or it might prompt them to
commit suicide, either of which was a wrong to society.
Mr. Freeman contended, nevertheless, that a
man had such a right&mdash;certainly he had, if he were not
in debt&mdash;but if he were, it was then his duty to live as
long as he could, to endeavour to pay his debts. Mr.
Freeman illustrated his points by allusions to Gen. Taylor
and Gen. Jackson&mdash;adding, "let the truth be told if
the heavens fall."</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman again opposed the new law passed
against gambling&mdash;for, he said, it was so shaped, that
if a man of property gambled, he could not be troubled,
but a poor, itinerant gambler could be punished. Mr.
Freeman read the law in proof&mdash;wherein a difference
certainly appeared to be made between those who had
something to live upon, and a merely itinerant gambler&mdash;the
latter liable to imprisonment if he kept a gaming
house, of from one to five years. Indeed, "being without
a fixed residence" is one of the features of the law.
Such a law appeared to Mr. Freeman as if, for example,
a man of standing were to go into a store and steal,
he would be let off&mdash;- whereas, if an itinerant man were
to steal, he must be punished with years of imprisonment.
The cases were parallel, and yet, it seemed to him
that a man of good standing ought to be punished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>more severely than the other, because his temptations
were not so great. Such a law, so partial, was a disgrace
to the statute-book. From what he knew of legislators,
he thought they had made such a law, knowing
that gambling was a bad vice, as a bugbear, to deter
people from engaging in it&mdash;and, in some cases, because
they were afraid of public opinion, and servilely followed
the crowd, lest at some future time they might lose their
election.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman said that he considered himself as an
anti-gambler&mdash;but injustice had been done to gamblers,
and he had defended them as far as he consistently could&mdash;and
if an audience would meet him on Tuesday night,
he would give them an anti-gambling lecture. He differed
with Mr. Green.</p>

<p>Mr. Green wished to know why Mr. Freeman should
dislike the law so much, if he considered gambling a bad
vice&mdash;he (Mr. Green) really did not understand such a
position. Such was the effect of gambling upon the mind,
that he was sure that when Mr. Freeman first lost his
money, (three thousand dollars,) and first became a gambler,
he would not have spoken as he had that night. A
young man, in gambling, was driven on by degrees, by
the excitement of cards, of fine wines, society, &amp;c. Gamblers
ridiculed all ideas of reform, and said to the young
man, you know all about us&mdash;we are called gamblers&mdash;and
the young man thinks he knows all about them, as
he finds them fascinating&mdash;but he knows nothing about
them. When the young man is ruined, what do the
gamblers do for him? Nothing. Such a young man in
Baltimore was thus ruined, and became a sot&mdash;and at
length had no place to sleep, unless the gamblers allowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>him. One night, he was awakened by the gambler
shaking him, and calling him a loafer. The poor man
said, "I do not deserve this at your hands. This was the
first house I gambled in." The gambler threw him down
stairs, and his head struck the curb-stone, and Mr. Green
lent him his handkerchief to bind up the wound, and prevented
further mischief being done to him. The next
day he was found under one of the wharves&mdash;<i>dead!</i>
And such was the treatment inflicted on him by the
gamblers. Mr. Green then defended the new law.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman said that he opposed the law because he
thought it discreditable to Pennsylvania&mdash;that there should
be a law to the effect that, "If I play cards, a man may
say to me&mdash;there, you have done an act that, if legally
visited, would send you to the Penitentiary." Mr. Freeman
illustrated his views by a reference to the explosion
of steamboats. Mr. Freeman said that there was never
but one gambler put into prison south of Mason &amp; Dixon's
line. Mr. Freeman hinted that Mr. Green at Harrisburg
had shown gambling tricks upon cards, with
packs that were known to him&mdash;prepared cards, in fact.
He thus astonished the natives. And this was one influence
brought in aid of a passage of the law.</p>

<p>A vote was then taken on the question&mdash;"Shall the
proceeds of this night be given to Mr. Freeman?" It was
decided in the affirmative by a large majority.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman did not deny that cheating was practised
by the gamblers. But Mr. Freeman contended that Mr.
Green could not perform the tricks, could not cheat with
cards that he was not familiar with. Mr. Freeman produced
a pack which he had just bought, and were other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>wise
untouched&mdash;and he said that Mr. Green could not
operate with that pack. He defied him.</p>

<p>Mr. Green said that this was no argument. But if Mr.
Freeman would agree, and the meeting would appoint a
committee of twelve citizens, he would before that committee
meet Mr. Freeman, and with those cards exhibit
tricks of gamblers.</p>

<p>Some discussion ensued, and it was agreed that a committee
should be appointed. Subsequently Mr. Green
said he would exhibit before the audience; but that if
Mr. Freeman shuffled the pack, he might of course disarrange
his (Mr. Green's) play. But Mr. Green had
contended that any gambler <i>in his own play</i> could cheat.
And Mr. Green displayed several extraordinary tricks,
in which he was remarkably successful, particularly in
illustrating the facility with which two partners in gambling
could win from their opponents with certainty.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, upon Mr. Freeman
submitting to the audience the question&mdash;"Have I sustained
my position?"&mdash;it was decided in the negative.
The question however, was not put until the audience
had risen to depart&mdash;but the response was general.</p>

<p class="center">From the Daily Sun.</p>

<p>We have been no inattentive observers of the debate
on gambling, between Mr. Green, and his able and plausible
antagonist, Mr. Freeman&mdash;who brought to the defence
of a bad cause, an energy, an earnestness, and a
power of illustration, which, on any other subject, must
have crowned him with the laurels of a brilliant victory.
But what power of logic&mdash;what force of elocution&mdash;- what
stretch, of fancy, <i>can</i> defend gambling?&mdash;which, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>if right <i>in itself</i>, is yet attended by such baneful consequences&mdash;such
appalling effects&mdash;as to strike terror into
the hearts of the most reckless, and seal the lips of eloquence
by the blood of the unfortunate? This was illustrated
in a most striking manner in the recent debate&mdash;where
a long tissue of false logic, on the part of Mr. Freeman,
was blown to the winds by the simple recital of a
<i>fact</i>, by Mr. Green detailing the death of a ruined gambler
by the hands of a prosperous one! <i>Blood</i> dispelled
all the illusions of logic. Argument evaporated before
the <i>corpse</i> of the victim. Applause for ingenious argument
was hushed in a moment, when the dead body of the
gambler appeared in view! What a tribute to the power
of <i>truth</i>&mdash;what a tremendous triumph of nature, and her
sacred laws, over the flimsy artifices of passion, fiction,
and a diseased imagination, fevered by habitual vice.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson says that the gambler is no better than a
robber, because he acquires property without an equivalent.
The whole gist of the argument lies here. You
strip a man of fortune, or tear from his hands the earnings
of a long life, and give him in return&mdash;<i>nothing!</i>
Mr. Freeman says, in answer to this&mdash;yes, you give him
the chance of robbing you! And he goes so far in his
sophistry, as to contend that if a man attempts to rob you
on the highway, you have a right to rob him! Such is
the language of the gambler, on the rule of right, who
wanting a principle of virtue, resorts to every extravagant
theory, to justify his violations of the first law of nature.</p>

<p>Justice is the foundation of all human institutions: and
this ordains, that no man shall take from another, what
is his own, without paying him an equivalent. The gam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>bler
pays no equivalent&mdash;and hence, he stands on the
same platform with the robber.</p>

<p>The strong point in the logic of Mr. Freeman was, that
<i>other professions</i> also acquire property without paying
an equivalent, and therefore gamblers were not criminal!
We marvelled that a man of his sagacity should venture
on so gross a sophism. He alluded to speculators and
stock-jobbers, who gained their thousands without an exchange
of values, and exulted that the gambler was no
worse. But could this make the gambler an honest man,
because other men were rogues? How desperate the
cause that could clutch at so frail a straw for support!
Yet Mr. Freeman appeared perfectly unconscious of the
imbecility of his reasoning. More perfect hallucination
we never beheld!</p>

<p>Every man <i>feels</i>, when he gains property without an
equivalent, that he has done a wrong. Every dollar so
acquired plants a fang in his heart. Conscience goads
him. He is miserable, restless, tortured, and for temporary
relief flies to the transient oblivion of the bowl. When
he wins, he drinks&mdash;and when he loses, he drinks to
desperation. He feels that when he wins, he is a rogue&mdash;and
that when he loses, he is a victim&mdash;no matter whether
gambler, speculator or stock-jobber&mdash;he has violated the
<i>rule of right</i>, by acquiring property without an equivalent;
and he feels the degradation of the robber, who cries
"stand!" to the passenger on the highway, and extorts
his purse, with the pistol at his breast.</p>

<p>Of the fascinating charms of gambling, history has left
us too many records to make us insensible of the importance
of the safe-guards which society ought to erect, to
defend itself from the poison of so infectious a contamina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>tion.
Who would believe, that the great <i>Wilberforce</i>
was once a gambler! That even <i>Pitt</i> once stood on the
brink of a gambler's hell. But Wilberforce was cured
by <i>winning</i> &pound;2000 at <i>Holland-house</i>&mdash;and such was the
pain he felt for those who had lost their money, that it
prevented all "his future triumphs in the infernal regions."
But in those regions, flourished the greatest statesmen
and wits of the age&mdash;who fell victims to the prevailing
fascination of the gaming-table. What destroyed <i>Charles
James Fox</i>, as a statesman? <i>Gambling!</i> What brought
the brilliant <i>Sheridan</i> to the grave? Intoxication, brought
on by the ill-starred luck of the ruined gamester? "<i>Holland-house!</i>"
immortalized as the resort of genius, as
well as for its orgies of dissipation, is not less renowned to
infamy, as having been the "hell" of respectable gamesters.</p>

<p>There is a kind of democracy of crime, contended for
by Mr. Freeman, that has its charms to the ears of the
groundlings. He is opposed to a law that punishes <i>one</i>
class of gamblers only, instead of bringing <i>all</i>, within the
focus of its penalties! There is much truth in this.
Laws ought to be equal in their operation&mdash;but if they
cannot be equal, this is no reason why there ought to be
no laws at all. This conclusion is not warranted by any
rule in logic or in government.</p>

<p>No man has a right to dispose of his property to the
corruption of the public morals. Mr. Freeman adduced
the instance of a father having a right to disinherit one
son and prefer the other. This is not a parallel case.
The parallel would be a rich man leaving his fortune to
found an Institution of demoralizing tendency&mdash;say to
teach you the art of cheating! The laws would annul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>such a bequest. Society has an original, inherent right
to defend itself from all evil&mdash;and that gaming is an evil,
whether played with cards, lotteries, dice, stocks, or betting,
not even Mr. Freeman could seriously deny.</p>

<p>In the late debate between these celebrated speculators,&mdash;one
reformed, the other confirmed in his vicious career&mdash;it
was observed, what a tower of strength <i>truth</i> gives
to the man who espouses the <i>just</i> cause. Mr. Green
stood self-vindicated by his very position&mdash;while the
labour of <i>Sisiphus</i> devolved on Mr. Freeman. But the
stone would not stay rolled up hill. It was no sooner at
midway from the summit, but back it rolled upon its unfortunate
and panting labourer.</p>

<p>The fostering power which <i>intemperance</i> derives from
the excitements of the gaming-table, would itself prove
an effectual argument against this monstrous infatuation,
if no other existed. But when we find intoxication, only
one of a legion of vices that attend on it&mdash;and that fraud,
cheating, forgery, swindling, robbery, murder, and suicide,
are its unfailing companions&mdash;we may well marvel that
it should find any man so reckless of public opinion, as
to venture its championship. Mr. Freeman went so far
in this mad advocacy of his darling pursuit, as to justify
<i>suicide</i>! In this, however, he was perfectly consistent&mdash;for
if gaming of any kind is right, so is murder, robbery,
and suicide. In this, Mr. Freeman over-reached himself&mdash;and
by attempting too much, exposed the futility
and weakness of his case.</p>

<p>One fact, of a highly useful import, was established by
this debate&mdash;and having received the concurrent attestation
of Mr. Freeman, must now be considered as no longer
open to doubt&mdash;that <i>cheating</i> is a necessary part of gam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>ing,
from which even <i>honourable</i> gamblers&mdash;(what a revolting
solecism!)&mdash;do not shrink! But this is not the
worst of the admissions made, in the course of this debate&mdash;which
we here enumerate:</p>

<p>1. The winner is always in danger of murder&mdash;and
runs for his life.</p>

<p>2. The loser becomes a cheat, a murderer, a suicide,
or a drunkard.</p>

<p>3. The tortures of the damned are common to all gamblers,
winners and losers.</p>

<p>4. Deception and lying are their common attributes.</p>

<p>5. Outlawed by public opinion&mdash;they wage implacable
war against the morals, peace, and happiness of society.</p>

<p>So many allusions have been made to the Laws of Ohio

to append them here, that the reader may judge
for himself how far the charges of impolicy, partiality, and
non-efficiency are justified by these instruments.</p>

<p>During the three evenings of the debate the Lecture-room
of the Museum was crowded with a most respectable
audience; and thousands must have read the reports
given by the different Newspapers on the following mornings.
Throughout the community there was considerable
excitement, and we have no doubt that good has already
resulted. The evils of gambling are now familiar to
many who never previously thought upon the subject;
and the excuses and defences urged for participating in
the vice have been stripped of their fallacious guises. For
this work we owe many thanks to the conductors of the
public press who have come forth ably and willingly to
our assistance.</p>

<p>But we trust that the immediate advantages from the
discussion are not the only ones. It will be perceived
from the reports given, that we met with no common
opponent. Mr. Freeman is perhaps not excelled, if he
has an equal, among gamblers, for talent, learning,
and, what is more rare, candour and honesty of character.
From a lecture which he has since delivered, we learn
that he was on a professional visit to Philadelphia, where
he had bought some implements for gambling and was about
to return to the South, when his attention was arrested by
a notice in a paper that Mr. Green was to give a lecture
in the Museum on the following evening. For some years
he had formed a resolution that if ever he had an opportunity
of hearing him, he would embrace it, and he now
concluded that he would stay another day for that purpose.
He did so, attended his lecture, and from antipathy
to himself and the course he was pursuing, was induced
to send the challenge to the Sun newspaper which led to
the debate in the preceding pages. It is not improbable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>that while thinking on the points he proposed to defend,
his naturally acute mind perceived their fallacy, as
there was a gradual shifting of his position from the subject
of the original challenge, till on the last evening of the
debate he ended with the astonishing announcement that
on the Tuesday following he would deliver a lecture
<i>against gambling</i> in the same place. Since then, he has
delivered several lectures on the same subject, has taken
the temperance pledge, been admitted into one of the divisions
of the Sons of Temperance, and promises fair to
be an efficient labourer in the cause of truth and virtue.
Like Paul, he seems to have been arrested midway in
his career, and by the power of conscience compelled to
build up what he once exerted himself to destroy. May
God prosper him in his labours, and give him grace to
continue unto the end.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LOTTERIES" id="LOTTERIES"></a>LOTTERIES.</h2>


<p>This is as deceptive, and as base a business, as was
ever introduced into any country. The apparent respectability
of it, and of the men who carry it on, is
calculated to remove the scruples many might otherwise
have to patronizing it. The facility with which it can
be patronized, without the liability of exposure, and the
promises of sudden gain so artfully held out, are inducements
not easily resisted by a money-loving people, totally
ignorant of the odds against them in the game they play.</p>

<p>All other games generally require the personal attention
of the players who patronize them; but this is a
game at which any one can play, and need never be
seen, even by those against whom he may be playing.
Thousands of persons, who stand high in the estimation
of their neighbors for good conduct; men who would
not, on any account, be found at a gambling-table, will
patronize lotteries. The ease with which it can be done,
without exposure, enables them to gratify, to the full extent
of their means, their passion for this base species of
swindling. In many of our large cities, numerous well-dressed
young men are constantly engaged in vending
tickets through the streets, or from house to house, and
they can be bought as privately as the buyer may wish,
or he may send his servant for them. Thus it is that a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>man may gamble as extensively as he pleases in lotteries,
without his proceedings being at all likely to become
public.</p>

<p>In my description of lotteries, I shall confine myself to
the lottery scheme before us; because it will serve as an
example of all others, and because the reader will be
better able to comprehend explanations of this system
than if I were to write of some scheme not here inserted.</p>

<p>By a reference to the tables of tickets, it will be seen
that there are fifteen packages of whole tickets, as many
of halves, and thirty packages of quarter tickets. Each
package contains all the numbers, from one up to seventy-eight,
without a repetition of any one of them. The
tickets found in these tables are all that are intended for
any one drawing; and every successive drawing is but
another edition of the same tickets, all arranged in the
same order, and with the same combination numbers; but
they have a different class number on them. The proprietors
of a lottery furnish the printer with a copy of
these tables, arranged in a blank book, and this book is
called the <i>scheme-book</i>, from which as many as may be
ordered from time to time are printed.</p>

<p>The arranging of the class numbers is a matter of
fancy, as to what they shall be; their only use being to
determine to what particular drawing any particular
ticket belongs, in order that a ticket which proves to be
a blank may not, at some future drawing, be handed in
for a premium, on account of containing some of the

<p><span class="smcap">The Drawing.</span> There are several methods of conducting
the drawing; but that which is most commonly
used is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a hollow wheel, as represented in the plate;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>then there are seventy-eight small tin tubes, scarcely
half an inch in diameter, and about three inches in
length; these are for holding the numbers, from one to
seventy-eight; each number is on a separate piece of
paper, which is rolled up and put into a tube; these
tubes, when the numbers have been placed in them, are
all put into the wheel, and a person is selected to draw
out one at a time from the wheel, which is opened, and
cried aloud, for the information of those present who
may be interested. The number is registered, for the
future guidance of the lottery-dealer, in determining
what he shall pay those who may hold one or more of
the numbers so drawn. After this, the wheel is again
turned, so as to mix well the numbers contained in it,
and a second is drawn; and the same proceedings are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>gone over with, until twelve numbers are drawn, and
registered in the order in which they are drawn. Sometimes
thirteen will be drawn, it being customary, on
many occasions, to draw one number for every six contained
in the wheel; but I cannot give this as a universal
rule, because I have often found it deviated from. Sometimes
little boys are selected to draw the numbers from
the wheel&mdash;to give the impression that every possible
step has been taken to render the management as fair as
possible; but in this there is also much deception.</p>

<p>Swarms of domestic servants, day labourers, and the
most poor and needy persons daily visit these worse
than gambling shops, where they risk their little all,
and get nothing in return but the delightful anticipation
of being rich when the "drawing" takes place.</p>

<p>True it has been the case that prizes have been
drawn, and trumpeted forth to the world, as inducements
for others to buy. Having known how some of
these prizes have sometimes been obtained, will it be
too much to suppose that others are obtained in like
manner? that is by the proprietors of lotteries being
swindled through the unfaithfulness of their agents. A
case came to my knowledge of a man who drew a
capital prize; and the mode of operation, by which it
was effected, was as follows: An agent, who was
stationed in a town some distance from the principal
establishment, made two confidants, who, doubtless,
readily acted with him from hope of gain. One of these
was the post-master of the town, and the other an acquaintance,
a patron of the lottery. The duty of the
agent was to transmit to the principal office all unsold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>tickets, by the first mail that left after the known hour
of drawing. This mail also conveyed the lists of the
drawing; but, in a regular manner of proceeding, they
would not have been accessible to the agent before the
departure of the stage with his unsold tickets. By making
a confidant of the post-master, however, he received
the lists as quick as possible after the mail arrived, and
before it had been assorted. He then examined his unsold
tickets, and if any considerable prize remained, he
would take it from among the unsold tickets, and despatch
the remainder to the principal office, and give the prize to
his other confidant; each one giving out that the ticket
had been sold to him; and accordingly the prize would
be claimed and paid, although fraudulently obtained. In
this particular case, the capital prize was drawn, and it
appeared that the ticket-holder appropriated all the
money to his own use, as he was known to buy much
property shortly afterwards. It is believed also, by those
who were acquainted with the incident, that he never divided
with the rascally agent; and thus was the cheater
cheated, who, in his wrath, let out some of the secrets
of the manner in which the prize was obtained.</p>

<p>This same man has since met with reverses of fortune,
and would now, I believe, find it difficult to raise money
sufficient to purchase a ticket even of a low price.</p>

<p>Among the many cases of lottery swindling, every
body has heard of the great Louisiana real estate lottery,
in which the prizes were to have been the St. Charles
Hotel, the Verandah, the St. Charles Theatre, the
Bank, the Arcade, and other magnificent buildings in
New Orleans. It is quite needless to say any thing of
this, as the public has been pretty well enlightened in
regard to it, through the public journals of the day.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

proprietors of the lottery immediately after a drawing,

<p>Now, let us spend a few moments in examining this
bill, and we shall see how much truth there is in it. It
says, that the ticket having on it the three first drawn
numbers will be entitled to the capital prize of $30,000.
Now, in the whole scheme before us, there is no such
ticket. The combination, 20, 51, 61, is not to be found
in this arrangement. Consequently, there was no ticket
whose numbers entitled it to this prize. Next, the bill
says, the ticket having the fourth, fifth, and sixth drawn
numbers, which would have been 24, 74, 77, would be
entitled to a prize of $10,000. There is no such ticket
in the combination. Consequently this also is false.
Now, it is evident that the dealers, in publishing this bill,
mean to impress the public with the idea, that tickets,
containing the necessary numbers to draw these prizes,
are in the lottery, and that somebody must, of course,
draw them; but it is all false, and a very little investigation
will convince any one, that a greater system of deception
can hardly exist. Bear in mind, that the bill says
these prizes were drawn. The third prize was $5,000,
and the ticket which contained the seventh, eighth, and
ninth numbers was to draw this prize. These numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>are 36, 46, 69. There is no such combination in the
scheme-book&mdash;no such ticket was printed or sold.
Consequently, here is another falsehood. The same can
be said of the fourth prize&mdash;the tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth numbers&mdash;being 3, 26, 29. There is no such
combination in the book, and no such prize could be
drawn. Of the next six prizes, of $1,500 each, said to
have been drawn, there was not a single ticket in the
whole scheme which contained the necessary numbers to
draw any one of these six prizes!</p>

<p>It is next asserted, that there were in the lottery one
hundred tickets, having three drawn numbers, and entitled
each to a prize of $1,000. This I have examined,
and I find that, instead of being one hundred, there are
but two&mdash;the first in magnitude being one from package
number six, of half tickets, bearing the numbers 20,
36, 51,&mdash;these being the first, second, and eighth of the
drawn numbers, and would entitle the holder to one half
of the $1,000, subject to a deduction of fifteen per cent.
The other is a quarter ticket, bearing the numbers 46,
51, 74&mdash;from the twenty-seventh package, of quarters&mdash;being
the second, fifth, and seventh of the drawn
numbers, and would entitle the holder of it to one
quarter of the $1,000, after deducting the fifteen per
cent. But it is well known that, frequently, scarce one
half of the tickets of any one class, intended for a particular
drawing, are ever disposed of, and are consequently
returned to the manager's office, to be destroyed. Then,
what guaranty have we that the numbers entitled to the
above pitiful prizes were sold? They are as likely to be
among the tickets returned unsold, as among those sold.
Next, the bill states that there were one hundred and ten
others, each having three drawn numbers, and were en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>titled
to a prize of $300 each. By a close investigation,
I find but one single ticket of this kind in the whole
scheme. This is the ticket in the twelfth package of
quarters, bearing the numbers 61, 69, 77; and if it had
been sold, it would have entitled the holder to one fourth
of the $300, deducting 15 per cent. Next, the bill
says, those sixty-six tickets having the first and second
drawn numbers, will each be entitled to a prize of $100.
In searching for these in the scheme-book, I find but
one that bears the first and second numbers; that is, in
package fourteen. The ticket having the numbers 20,
51, 66, is the only one having the two first numbers; and
if sold, the holder was entitled to one half of the $100,
it being a half ticket. Now, the reader may perceive
that I have examined and laid open, so that he too may
examine, this masterpiece of villany. I find that of the
two hundred and eighty-six highest prizes, which, their
own handbill states, existed in their lottery, and which,
by their own figures, amounted to the enormous sum
of $195,967, and, in order to be drawn, only required
that the tickets should be bought,&mdash;I find, allowing every
ticket to have been sold, and afterwards every holder
presented his ticket for the sum to which it might be
entitled, that of the two hundred and eighty-six said to be
in the scheme, there are but five, and these very
inconsiderable; and that the greatest amount of these five
prizes, without deducting the fifteen per cent, is only
$875, instead of the enormous sum of $195,967. Can
it be possible that any person will be found to patronize
lotteries, after considering these facts?</p>

<p>I pass over those small prizes named after the first
sixty-six having the first and second drawn numbers on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>them, and will prove the balance to be falsehoods, as
the greater portion of the first part of the bill is.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us see how many prizes are represented
to exist, not to say any thing of the blanks. In
counting up the prizes named on this bill, we find them
to be 30,316; and I do not think they would pretend
to say that more than one half of their tickets were
prizes. Then we will say that they had an equal number
of blanks. This would carry their scheme up to
over sixty thousand tickets; and even if they were all
prizes, and no blanks, (which they do not pretend,) who
cannot see the extreme improbability of their disposing
of 30,316 tickets in one week? for it must be remembered
that these were all of one class, and for one particular
week's drawing. But the last witness, whose
overwhelming testimony will settle the question, is their
own scheme-book, of which an accurate copy is here
given, and which shows the number of tickets, for any
one drawing, to be but 1,560, the half of which, by
great exertion, they might succeed in selling; each successive
drawing being another edition of these same
combinations, with a different class number on them.
Now, let me ask, where are their 30,316 prizes to come
from? What a scheme of deception do we here behold!
and one, too, that has been so long submitted to and
patronized by the public of this and other countries.</p>

<p>Another method of still further swindling the buyers of
tickets, is much practised in some parts of the country.
The agents who sell the tickets are authorized to insure
them. When a man buys one, the price, perhaps, might be
ten dollars. The seller, if he has been authorized, will say,
"Now, sir, for ten dollars, I will insure your ticket to draw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>a prize." This is enough for the buyer to have his ticket
insured to draw a prize, and possibly the capital
prize: he pays an additional fee, and the agent forwards
the numbers of all the tickets, so insured, to the office
where the drawing is to be held; and there they manage
to have these tickets contain one (seldom more) of
the drawn numbers. This entitles the buyer to receive
back the price of his ticket, after taking out 15 per cent.;
and as it was not a total blank, the insurer is safe, and
retains the sum paid for insurance. The buyer remains
swindled out of the insurance, and 15 per cent, of the
cost. These swindling shops are numerous, and are
sometimes called <i>policy offices</i>.</p>

<p>We sincerely hope that our readers will examine with
some attention the developments we have made in relation
to the deceptive schemes of the lottery managers;
for we feel that they cannot fail to convince every man
of common sense, who has a particle of moral principle
and moral honesty left, that he who encourages this
basest of all swindling, by purchasing tickets, is not
alone an enemy to himself and family, but he countenances
a species of gambling that is extensively mischievous
and ruinous, and has for its victims many of
our best citizens, young and old; while, at the same
time, he unintentionally throws a veil over the villanous
deeds of the lottery gambler and his unprincipled, as well
as his inexperienced supporters. We once more invite
our readers to examine our statements with attention.</p>

<p>The venders of lottery tickets possess an immense advantage
over the buyer, which is mostly in the extreme
improbability of a prize of any considerable amount
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>being drawn. The numbers 1 to 78 are capable of
making 76076 combinations on what I may term the
increasing ratio&mdash;that is, the second larger than the
first, and the third larger than the second, in arithmetical
progression; as, 5, 10, 15, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the following combinations there are but 1560,
where there might be 76076; and if this latter number
were printed and sold, some one must hold the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>first drawn numbers, every ticket-holder having one
chance out of 76076 of drawing the capital prize. But,
in this combination, if a man were to purchase the whole
of the tickets, being 1560, there would still be 49 chances
against his holding the three first numbers, to one for it.
As there are no two tickets holding the same three
numbers, of course but one can hold the three first,
which is the prize.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>By a little investigation, any one may discover that his
chance for drawing a prize, even of a trifling amount, is
extremely small. By the following method any one may
ascertain the number of combinations which any given
number will produce, as in the present case, 78 &times; 77
&times; 76 = 456456 &divide; 6 = 76076, the number of combinations
of three numbers each; the 78 multiplied by 77,
and the product by 76, and that product divided by 6
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>gives the number of combinations of three numbers each,
which the numbers from 1 to 78 will produce, no two
combinations containing the same three numbers.</p>

<p>Lottery-dealers are aware of the great odds against the
buyers, and are very cautious in keeping all the secrets
of a fraud to themselves, by which they are robbing the
public continually. But it shall not be the fault of the
writer of these pages if their swindling machinations are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>longer concealed from the community. Thousands upon
thousands of dollars are expended annually in lottery
tickets in this country; and how very seldom is it that you
hear of a capital prize having been drawn! If there should
chance to be a prize of any magnitude awarded to a
ticket-holder, it is trumpeted from one end of the Union
to the other, by those most interested in lottery speculations,
stimulating others to try their luck, and by that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>means making their very losses minister to their gain;
for, in all likelihood, months and years may elapse before
another large prize will be drawn from the same lottery.</p>

<h4>FALLACY OF LOTTERIES AS A MEANS OF REVENUE.</h4>

<p>We are indebted for the following exposition to our
moral friend, Capt. John Maginn, of New York city.</p>

<p>"Although they may produce, by the various deceptive
allurements which they hold forth, a temporary
influx into the treasury of the state, yet the prostration
of industry, the formation of idle habits, intemperance
and various other vices, have invariably been the consequences
wherever they have been introduced. No
farther evidence of this position is requisite than the
fact that in England, where many of the common necessaries
of life are heavily taxed, it has been satisfactorily
ascertained from observation, that for several days preceding
the drawing of a lottery, the consumption of such
articles was very materially diminished. It is moreover
equally true, that a very small proportion of the tax actually
paid, through the purchase of lottery tickets, is
available to the state: by far the greater part being
absorbed in the expenses, profits, &amp;c., of managers and
venders."</p>


<h4><a name="INSURING_NUMBERS" id="INSURING_NUMBERS"></a>INSURING NUMBERS, OR POLICY DEALING.</h4>

<p>As the system of insuring numbers is at present
practised to a fearful extent in this city, and as its votaries
are mostly the ignorant and unthinking portion of
the community, we proceed to give a plain matter-of-fact
investigation of the chances.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>There being on the day of drawing a certain number
of tickets in the wheel, out of which a particular number
of them are to be drawn, it follows that there are so
many chances to one against a given number being
drawn as the number which are to be drawn are contained
in the entire number of tickets in the wheel. To
illustrate this practically, suppose you would insure the
payment of $100 upon the event of a certain number
being drawn from the lottery wheel to-day; suppose it
is a 78 number lottery, and that 12 ballots are to be
drawn; the chance then is evidently 78/12, or 6.5 to 1 that
you lose: accordingly, in order to make the chances
equal, you must pay 100/6.5, or $15.38, for insurance: if
therefore the insurer should ask $32, there would be
about $16 fraud: in other words, you would have to
contend against about 100 per cent. The only inducement
for the insurer to pursue this vile practice, in defiance
of constitutions and laws, is a liberal per centage.
This varies from 30 to 70, and even 125 per cent.
Under circumstances like these, when the chances of
gain are obviously so remote, it would seem incredible
that any one endowed with even ordinary sagacity
could be so deluded&mdash;so desperate&mdash;as to adventure;
though, sad to relate, hundreds and hundreds in this
city daily spend their little all in effecting insurance on
numbers, and that, too, at the sacrifice of the common
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>Another system of insurance, which we will proceed
to analyze, is effected by what is termed a station number.
The adventurer selects a number, and declares
that it will come out the first or second drawn, or in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>some other place, for which he pays six cents, and if
the number is drawn in the order indicated, he is to receive
$2.50. To illustrate this, suppose you select a
certain number, which you declare will be the third
drawn; suppose also that it is a 78 number lottery, and
that there are 12 drawn ballots. In this case there are
evidently 78/12 = 6.5 chances to 1 against the selected
number being drawn. It is also plain that should it be
a drawn number, there are 12 chances to 1 against it
being drawn in any particular order; wherefore it
follows, that there are 6.5x12 = 78 chances to 1 against
the selected number being the third or any other particular
drawn number. Accordingly, to equalize the
chances, in case of winning you should receive 78x6
= $4.68; hence, under these circumstances the insurer
gains $2.18, which is nearly 100 per cent. Again,
suppose it is a 98 number lottery, and that you pay 25
cents: here we have 98x25 = $24.50, the sum you
ought to receive in case of winning, instead of which
you only receive 25/6x2.5 = $10.626; hence the insurer
gains $13.975, or more than 125 per cent.</p>


<h4>PROF. GODDARD ON LOTTERIES.</h4>

<p>We give below a very able memorial, from the pen
of Prof. <span class="smcap">Goddard</span>, of Brown University, to the Legislature
of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The undersigned, citizens of Rhode Island, have long
regarded the lottery system with unqualified reprobation.
They believe it to be a multiform social evil, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>obnoxious to the severest reprehension of the moralist,
and which it is the duty of the legislator, in all cases,
to visit with the most effective prohibitory sanctions.
Entertaining these convictions, the undersigned memorialists
cannot withhold them from the Hon. General Assembly
of Rhode Island. They invoke the General
Assembly to exercise their constitutional powers,
promptly and decisively, for the correction of a long-continued,
and wide-spread, and pestilent social evil.
They ask them, most respectfully and earnestly, to
withdraw, as soon as may be, all legislative sanction of
the lottery system, and to save Rhode Island from the
enduring reproach of being among the last States to
abandon that system. The memorialists beg leave to
disclaim, in this matter, all personal or political considerations.
They are seeking neither to help nor to
hurt any political party. They contemplate no aggression
upon the rights or the character of individuals.
They are engaged in no impracticable scheme of moral
reform. They have no fondness for popular agitation.
They are what they profess to be, citizens of Rhode
Island, and it is only in the quality of citizens of Rhode
Island, that they now ask the General Assembly to
resort to the most operative penal enactments, for the
entire suppression of a system which exists, and which
can exist only to disgrace the character of the State, and
to injure both the morals and the interests of the people.
The memorialists are persuaded that a commanding
majority of the citizens of every political party entertain
sentiments of decided hostility to all lotteries. In praying,
therefore, for legislative interposition, they feel that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>they are not in advance of public opinion, that they are
not urging the General Assembly to anticipate public
opinion, but only to imbody it; to accelerate its salutary
impulses, and to augment its healthful vigour. The
constitutional power of the legislature to interfere in the
premises being undisputed, the memorialists beg leave
to submit, for consideration, a few only of the many
reasons which have forced upon their minds the conclusion&mdash;that
Rhode Island should lose no time and
spare no effort in extirpating the lottery system:&mdash;a
system which has already worked extensive evil within
her borders; which is repugnant to a cultivated moral
sense; and which has been branded, both as illegal and
immoral, by some of the most enlightened governments
upon earth. In this connection, it should be stated,
that England, and, it is believed, France likewise, have
abandoned the lottery system. Some of the most populous
and influential States in this Confederacy have
abandoned it. Massachusetts has abandoned it; Pennsylvania
has abandoned it; New York has abandoned
it. Nay more, so hostile were the people of the latter
State to the lottery system, that in revising its Constitution
a few years since, they adopted a provision which
prohibits the Legislature from ever making a lottery
grant. These examples are adduced to show the progress
of an enlightened public sentiment upon this
subject, and to exhibit the grateful spectacle of governments,
differently constituted, exercising their powers
for the best interests of the people. The evils which
the lottery system creates, and the evils which it exasperates,
are so various and complicated, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>undersigned memorialists cannot attempt an enumeration.
They are so revolting as to furnish no motive for
rhetorical exaggeration. A few only of these evils the
undersigned memorialists will now proceed to mention.</p>

<p>1. Lotteries are liable to many of the strongest objections
which can be alleged against gambling. They
have thus far escaped, it is true, the infamy of gambling,
but they can plead no exemption from its malignant
consequences. Like gamblers, they are hostile&mdash;not to
say fatal&mdash;to all composure of thought and sobriety of
conduct. Like gambling, they inflame the imagination
of their victims and their dupes, with visions of ease,
and affluence, and pleasure, destined never to be realized.
Like gambling, they seduce men, especially the credulous
and the unthinking, from the pursuits of regular
industry, into the vortex of wild adventure and exasperated
passions. Like gambling, they ultimately create
a necessity for constant vicious excitement. Like
gambling, they often lead to poverty and despair, to
insanity and to suicide. Like gambling, they furnish
strong temptations to fraud, and theft, and drunkenness.
Like gambling, they work, in but too many cases, a
permanent depravation of all moral principle and all
moral habits. This fearful parallel might easily be extended.
The picture here presented of the evils of
lotteries, however fearful it may seem, is not overdrawn.
This picture will be owned as just, by many a bereaved
widow and by many a forsaken wife, who trace all
their woes to the temptation into which this <i>respectable</i>
and legalized species of gambling had betrayed once
affectionate husbands. It will be owned as just by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>many a child, who has been doomed perchance to a
heritage of ignorance and poverty, by a father, for whose
weak virtue the potent fascinations of the lottery were
found too strong. In many respects, the lottery system
may be deemed even more pernicious than ordinary
gambling. It spreads a more accomplished snare; it is
less offensive to decorum; it is less alarming to consciences
which have not lost all sensitiveness; it numbers
among its participants multitudes of those who
ought to blush and to tremble for thus hazarding their
own virtue, and for thus corrupting the virtues of others;
it draws within its charmed circle men and women who
fill up every gradation of age, and character, and fortune.</p>

<p>2. The lottery system, as at present constituted,
presents the strongest temptations to fraud on the part
of all those who are concerned either in the drawing
of lotteries or in the sale of tickets. It is not known
that fraud has in any case been perpetrated, though
fraud is suspected. If perpetrated, it would be no easy
matter to detect it. The ignorant and the credulous
men and women, who seek to better their fortunes by
gambling in lottery tickets, know nothing of those
mystical combinations of numbers, on which their fate
is suspended. Utter strangers as they are to all the
"business transactions" of the lottery system, if cheated
at all, they are cheated without remedy.</p>

<p>3. The lottery system operates as a most oppressive
tax upon the community. This tax is paid, not by the
rich and luxurious&mdash;but it is paid mainly by those who
are struggling for independence, and by those who earn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>their bread by the sweat of their brow&mdash;by the servants
in our kitchens&mdash;by clerks and apprentices, and day-labourers;
by mechanics and traders; by the men and
women who work in our factories; and in too many
instances, it is to be feared, by our hardy yeomanry,
who, impatient of the slow profits of agriculture, vainly
expect from the chances of the lottery that which is
never denied to the efforts of industry. The amount of
pauperism and crime, of mental agitation and perchance
of mental insanity, which the lottery system must create
among these numerous classes, it would not be easy to
calculate.</p>

<p>4. Lotteries are the parent of much of the pauperism
which is to be found in this young, and free, and prosperous
land. It entails poverty upon multitudes directly,
by exhausting their limited means in abortive experiments
to get rich by "high prizes"&mdash;and, yet more, by
withdrawing multitudes from a dependence on labour,
and accustoming them to hope miracles of good fortune
from chance. After repeated disappointments, they
discover, when it is too late to profit from the discovery,
how sadly they have been duped, and how recklessly
they have abandoned their confidence in themselves,
and in that gracious Being who never forsakes those
who put their trust in him. They sink into despondency,
and, seeking to forget themselves, they bring upon
their faculties the brutal stupor of intoxication, or they
exhilarate them by its delirious gayety. Suicide is
often the fearful issue. Dupin ascribes a hundred cases
of suicide <i>annually</i> to the lottery system in the single
city of Paris. Many years ago a lottery scheme, dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>playing
splendid prizes, was formed in London. Adventures
to a very large amount was the consequence,
and the night of the drawing was signalized by fifty
cases of suicide!</p>

<p>5. Success in lotteries is hardly less fatal than failure.
The fortunate adventurer is never satisfied. He ventures
again and again, till ruin overtakes him. After
all the tempting promises of wealth, which are made
by those concerned in this iniquitous system, how very
few, except managers of lotteries and venders of lottery
tickets, has it ever made rich! and well may it be
asked, whom has it ever made more diligent in business,
more contented, and respectable, and happy?</p>

<p>6. Lotteries, it is believed, are rendered especially
mischievous in this country by the nature of our institutions,
and by the spirit of the times. Here, the path to
eminence being open to every one&mdash;but too many are
morbidly anxious to improve their condition; and by
means, too, which in the wisdom of Providence were
never intended to command success. A mad desire
for wealth pervades all classes&mdash;it feeds all minds with
fantastic hope; it is hostile to all patient toil, and legitimate
enterprise, and economical expenditure. It
generates a spirit of reckless speculation; it corrupts
the simplicity of our tastes; and, what is yet worse, it
impairs, not unfrequently, in reference to the transactions
of business, the obligations of common honesty. Upon
these elements of our social condition and character, the
lottery system operates with malignant efficacy.</p>

<p>The undersigned memorialists are far from thinking
that, in the preceding remarks, they have exhausted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>the argument against the lottery system. They have
dwelt, in general terms, upon only some of its more
prominent evils. They do not allow themselves to
believe that, aside from the ranks of those who have a
direct personal interest in this system, a man of character
could be found in Rhode Island to defend it. The
memorialists deem lotteries to be in Rhode Island a
paramount social evil. They entreat the General Assembly
to survey this evil in all its phases, and then to
apply the remedy. The interposition which is now
asked at the hands of the Legislature has been delayed
too long, either for the interests or for the character of
the state. It is time that we protected our interests,
and retrieved our character. It is time that the lottery
had ceased to be the "<i>domestic institution</i>" of Rhode
Island. It is time that we abandoned, and abandoned
for ever, the policy of supporting schools, and building
churches, with the wages of iniquity. The memorialists
are aware that the General Assembly have made lottery
grants, which have not yet expired. They seek not in
any way to interfere with those grants; but in concluding
this expression of their views, they cannot avoid
repeating their earnest entreaty that the legislature
would come up without unnecessary delay to the great
work of reforming an abuse, which no length of time,
or patronage of numbers, or policy of state, should be
permitted to shelter for another hour.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'>EXTRACTS <i>from a Report to the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism
in the city of New York.</i></p>

<p>"It is not possible to estimate the sum that may have
been drawn from the people by lottery devices. Nor
is it possible to estimate the number of poor people that
have engaged in lottery gambling. We have been told,
that more than two hundred of these deluded people
have been seen early in the mornings at the lottery
offices, pressing to know their fate. <i>There</i> might be
seen the anxiety, the disappointment, and mortification,
of unfortunate beings, who had lost their all!</p>

<p>"Thus we see that this demoralizing contagion has
spread its destructive influence over the most indigent
and ignorant of the community. The injurious system
of lotteries opens a wide door to gambling, fraud and
imposition; of which the speculating, dishonest, idle,
profligate and crafty avail themselves, and deceive the
innocent and ignorant.</p>

<p>"If we place this subject in a pecuniary view as it
relates to the public funds, the mischievous effect is
more obvious. From an estimate, made by a gentleman
of accurate calculation, it appears, that the expense, or
the amount drawn from the people, to raise by lottery
the net sum of 30,000 dollars, amounts to $170,500,
including the expense of the managers and their attendants,
the clerks and attendants of the lottery offices, the
expense of time lost by poor people, and the amount
paid the proprietors of lottery offices. This enormous
sum is paid for the collection of only 30,000 dollars.
This is, therefore, not only the most expensive, but also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>the most demoralizing method that was ever devised to
tax the people.</p>

<p>"Upon the whole view of the subject, your committee
are decidedly of opinion, that lotteries are the most injurious
kind of taxation, and the very worst species of
Gambling. By their insidious and fascinating influence
on the public mind, their baleful effect is extended, and
their mischievous consequences are most felt by the
indigent and ignorant, who are seduced, deceived, and
cheated out of their money, when their families are
often suffering for the necessaries of life. Their principles
are vitiated by lotteries, they are deceived by vain
and delusive expectation, and are led into habits of idleness
and vice, which produce innumerable evils, and,
ultimately, end in misery and pauperism."</p>


<h4><a name="LOTTERY_COMBINATIONS" id="LOTTERY_COMBINATIONS"></a>LOTTERY COMBINATIONS.</h4>

<p>The numbers on lottery tickets are formed by combinations
of certain numbers previously agreed upon; as
from 1 to 60, 1 to 75, 1 to 78, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Combination consists in taking a less number of things
out of a greater, without any regard to the order in
which they stand; no two combinations having the same
quantities or numbers.</p>

<p><i>Problem.</i>&mdash;To find the number of combinations which
can be taken from any given number of things, all different
from each other, taking a given number at a time.</p>

<p><i>Rule.</i>&mdash;Take a series of numbers, the first term of
which is equal to the number of things out of which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>combinations are to be made, and decreasing by 1, till
the number of terms is equal to the number of things to
be taken at a time, and the product of all the terms.</p>

<p>Then take the natural series 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., up to the
number of things to be taken at a time, and find the
product of all the terms of this series.</p>

<p>Divide the former product by the latter, and the quotient
will be the answer.</p>

<p>How many combinations of 3 numbers can be taken
out of 78 numbers?</p>

<p>We have sufficient experience in lottery gambling to assure the
community that their whole system is as foul as highway robbery.
We purchased a wheel from one of the fraternity in Washington
City, and drew in Philadelphia three times, then carried it to
Washington, and there demonstrated to the satisfaction of those
who witnessed our drawing, that what we asserted was true to the
letter. We copy the notices of the American Courier, one of the
first papers of our country in the cause of humanity, and ever
ready to diffuse that which will promote the happiness and
welfare of mankind.</p>

<p class='center'>"GREEN'S LOTTERY,</p>

<p>"On Saturday night, drew the prize of fifty dollars for the proprietor,
he having declared to the audience the intention of giving
them blanks, which he did to the satisfaction of the judges. We
have the best authority for stating the belief that his expositions
will prove not only interesting, but highly beneficial, in opening
the eyes of thousands to the frauds practised in the shape of fairness
by the lottery managers."</p>

<p>After which the editor received the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="rightheader"><i>Frederick, June 9th, 1848.</i></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;Will you oblige some of your readers by giving them
an idea of "Green's" manner of exposition of frauds, as practised
by the lottery managers? and by so doing, no doubt but you will
confer a favour on many of your subscribers.</p>

<p><span class="i4">Respectfully, B.</span><br />
<span class="i8">A. M'Makin, Esq., <i>Ed. American Courier, Philad.</i></span></p>

<p class='center' style="font-size: small;">EXPLANATION.</p>

<p>In obedience to the request of "B," we have conversed with a
gentleman who was one of a committee of the audience to superintend
the drawing of "Green's Lottery" on a recent occasion. He
says that the tickets were prepared and distributed precisely after
the plan of the regular lottery managers, with the exception that
Mr. Green announced to the audience that he had purposely reserved
certain combinations of numbers, which he knew by calculation
would draw for him the highest prize, and leave for them <i>blanks
only!</i>&mdash;Each individual in the audience held a ticket, with a different
combination of numbers, such as they choose to select from
the packages opened to them. The numbers were placed in the
wheel precisely in the usual way, the drawing conducted by the
committee from the audience, and on the announcement of the
drawn numbers it was discovered, sure enough, that the audience
had received all blanks, and upon Mr. Green pointing to a package
on the table reserved for himself, it was examined by the committee,
and lo! there lay the ticket having the combination of
numbers drawing <i>the capital prize</i>!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed. A.C.</span></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>


<p class='center'><i>Communicated to the American Courier from Washington, D.C.</i></p>

<p>Green's great Consolidated Lottery drew in this city on the 22d
inst. The Reformed Gambler astonished a highly respectable
audience at his complete exposition of the fraud practised by
lottery speculators throughout our Union. Mr. Green stated to the
audience that though he wished them to understand the lottery
system to be fraught with deception, he did not wish it to be
understood that he was competent to make a clear and comprehensive
exposition. This was his fourth effort, and he had succeeded
in three to the satisfaction of his audience.</p>

<p>He then stated that he would draw from the ternary combination
of 42 numbers, and take therefore 8 drawn ballots, being equal to
15 in 75. He then placed in R.H. Gillet's hand 42 tickets, which
he declared contained the drawn numbers, where any 3 numbers
should be upon a ticket. Having explained satisfactorily his intentions,
he requested Mr. J. Thaw to act as his commissioner, Mr.
Thaw being well known as a gentleman of integrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Green then requested Mr. Gillet to mark the numbers from
1 to 42, so that there should be no doubt resting upon the mind of
any one that they were the same numbers which should afterwards
be drawn out. The tickets were marked, and Mr. Thaw deposited
them singly in tin tubes, from 1 to 42. Mr. Thaw then revolved
the wheel, mixing them thoroughly; he then drew one at a time,
until he drew 8, being the correct drawn ballots. Mr. Green then
asked the audience if they had any prizes. Receiving a negative
answer, he stated that he could draw one half of the numbers from
the wheel and still they should have none, though they had some
400 tickets against his 42. The commissioner continued drawing,
the prizes still falling in the manager's package, and the numbers
from 1 to 29 were taken out of the 42 before the audience received
a full compliment of 3 numbers on a ticket. The drawing appeared
fair; the numbers placed in the wheel were those taken
out. The wheel is one Mr. G. purchased from a lottery vender in
Washington city. Mr. G.'s explanation of his power to prevent
prizes being drawn without his consent appeared very satisfactory.
He declared that the managers had it in their power to assort out
certain numbers, and by the villany of those concerned in the distribution,
were enabled to keep any numbers from the hands of
the drawer.</p>

<p>I must own that this exposition of Green's has taken me altogether
by surprise. I did think that the deluded thousands who
live on, day after day, in the vain hope of a prize, instead of depending
solely upon their industry, skill, and talents, had some
remote chance of getting a good drawn number. But, it seems
that this is all a delusion, and that lotteries can be "stocked" as
well as a pack of cards.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
